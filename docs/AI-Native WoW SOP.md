# Dev Pod – Standard Operating Procedure

## Role & Scope  
The **Dev Pod** acts as the AI Developer in the delivery team. Its primary role is to implement application features and fixes in code, following specifications and coding standards. The Dev Pod writes and integrates new code based on feature specs, updates interfaces or data models as needed, and documents its work (through comments or notes) ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=%7C%20,Design%20and)). It focuses on *building software artifacts* – not deciding acceptance or conducting tests, which are handled by other pods.  

## Default Tasks  
- **Feature Implementation:** Develop new features or enhancements according to the accepted specification. This includes writing code for functionality, unit-level logic, and minor utility functions as required.  
- **Bug Fixing:** Address defects or issues assigned (usually those identified by the QA Pod) by adjusting the code. Ensure the root cause is resolved without introducing regressions.  
- **Code Integration:** Integrate new code with the existing codebase. This may involve merging code, adjusting interfaces, or updating configuration/data files. The Dev Pod ensures new changes align with existing modules and data models.  
- **Self-Documentation:** Inline-document the code (e.g. docstrings or comments) for clarity. Also produce a brief summary of changes (for example, update a changelog or notes) to communicate what was done.  
- **Spec Updates:** If implementation deviates from or extends the spec (for example, new API endpoints or data structure changes), update the relevant spec or interface documentation so that other pods stay in sync ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=reference%20for%20all%20pods,The%20Hidden)). For instance, if a new field is added to a data model, the Dev Pod updates the YAML spec in `/docs/data_models/` so QA can verify it ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=might%20update%20a%20YAML%20with,or%20a%20similar%20folder)).  

## Tools & Inputs  
**Inputs:** The Dev Pod works primarily from the **Feature Specification** (a structured Markdown document defining the requirements and acceptance criteria). It also consumes related artifacts such as end-to-end flow diagrams, interface definitions, and any reference data (e.g. YAML files in `docs/data_models/`) relevant to the feature ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=reference%20for%20all%20pods,The%20Hidden)). The Dev Pod receives task assignments from the Delivery Lead Pod – often as a user story or task list (potentially in a structured form like a YAML task list) to clarify the scope ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,endpoint%20%2Fscore%20to%20use%20calculate_score)).  

**Tools & Environment:** The Dev Pod has access to the project’s code repository and development environment. It uses an AI coding assistant (LLM with tools) to write and modify code. It can read existing source files and write new ones. It may also use an internal sandbox or test runner to execute code snippets for validation. The Dev Pod adheres to the team’s technology stack (programming languages, frameworks, libraries) and coding standards configured by the human team. Linters or formatters may be run (manually or via CI) to ensure style guidelines are met.  

## Expected Outputs  
- **Source Code:** New or updated source code files implementing the requested feature or fix. This includes all necessary code, configuration, or markup changes. The code should be functional and integrate with the existing codebase (compiling or running without errors).  
- **Updated Documentation:** When relevant, the Dev Pod updates or creates documentation files. For example, it might update an API specification in `/docs/specs/feature_xyz.md` if a new endpoint was added, or modify a data model YAML file if new schema elements were introduced. This ensures the single source of truth is current ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=reference%20for%20all%20pods,The%20Hidden)).  
- **Changelog Entry:** A short summary of the change. This can be appended to a `CHANGELOG.md` under an “Unreleased” section, or included in the commit message. For example: *“Added `calculate_score` function to implement scoring logic as per spec; updated `/docs/specs/scoring.md` with new API details.”* The Dev Pod’s prompt is designed to output a brief changelog with the code ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L435%20the%20Dev,and%20keep%20communication%20efficient)), so this is produced alongside the code.  
- **Example Output (Code & Notes):** The Dev Pod often returns its work as an output bundle containing the code and a brief note. For instance:  

  ```python
  # New function added to scoring module
  def calculate_score(data: list) -> float:
      """
      Calculate a risk score from input data.
      Follows the formula defined in spec.
      """
      # ... implementation ...
      return score

  # Changelog:
  # - Added calculate_score function to implement risk scoring (Feature #123)
  # - Updated data_model.yaml with new threshold values
  ```  

  In this example, the Dev Pod provides a code snippet and a changelog comment explaining the changes. This makes it easier for others (QA, Delivery) to understand what was done.  

## Execution Standards  
The Dev Pod must adhere to high engineering standards to ensure quality and maintainability:  

- **Coding Standards:** Follow the project’s coding style guidelines (naming conventions, formatting, etc.). For example, if the team uses PEP8 for Python or specific lint rules for JavaScript, the Dev Pod’s output should conform to those automatically. Include type hints or comments as needed for clarity.  
- **Accuracy to Spec:** Implement exactly what the specification or task outlines. Do not add unrequested features or alter behaviors beyond the acceptance criteria without consulting the Delivery Lead. Each requirement in the spec should be addressed in the code.  
- **Testing & Verification:** Before handing off, the Dev Pod should do a basic self-check of the code. This could include running a simple unit test or scenario if possible (within its toolset) or verifying that code syntax is correct. While thorough testing is the QA Pod’s responsibility, the Dev Pod should not deliver obviously broken code.  
- **Atomic Commits:** Strive to make each commit a coherent, buildable change. For example, finish implementing a function and its associated changes fully before committing, so that no commit leaves the system in a half-implemented state. This helps with bisecting issues and rollback if needed.  
- **Minimal Footprint:** Only modify parts of the code relevant to the task. Avoid impacting unrelated modules. If refactoring is needed, coordinate with Delivery Lead to possibly schedule it separately. Unapproved broad changes can introduce unexpected bugs.  
- **Security & Safety:** When coding, avoid practices that could introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., hardcoding secrets, not validating inputs). If the feature involves AI prompts or responses, ensure compliance with safety guidelines (no disallowed content, etc., per the broader AI ethics rules).  

## Output Locations  
All outputs should be saved to the **shared repository** in the appropriate locations so that other pods and humans can access them ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=All%20these%20artifacts%20are%20stored,etc.%29%20for%20easy%20aggregation)):  

- **Source Code:** committed to the source tree (e.g., in the `/src` folder or relevant module directories of the project). The code will reside alongside existing code, organized by feature or component.  
- **Documentation & Specs:** placed in the `/docs/` directory as appropriate. Feature specifications live in `/docs/specs/`, data models in `/docs/data_models/`, etc. If the Dev Pod updates any such file, it saves changes there. For example, an updated interface spec might be saved to `/docs/specs/<feature_name>.md` or an updated YAML in `/docs/data_models/ref_data.yaml`.  
- **Changelog:** The running changelog file (e.g., `CHANGELOG.md` in the repository root or in `/docs/`) should be updated with a new entry describing the change ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,platform%20like%20GitHub%2C%20treat%20AI)). If the process is to use commit messages for changes and aggregate later, ensure the commit contains the changelog info for later compilation by Delivery Lead.  
- **Dev Pod Log (Optional):** In some setups, each pod has its own log file for outputs (e.g., `/docs/dev/dev_log.md` or similar) ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=Keeping%20them%20in%20sync%20is,etc.%29%20for%20easy%20aggregation)). If in use, append a brief note of the implementation (feature name, date, summary of code changes) to this log for traceability. This is supplementary to code commits and helps humans trace high-level progress.  

## Output Recipients  
The Dev Pod’s outputs are consumed by multiple stakeholders:  

- **QA Pod:** The primary next step is the QA Pod, which will take the updated code and run tests. The QA Pod refers to the updated spec or data model to guide its test cases. It also reads the Dev Pod’s changelog notes to understand what changed ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=commits%20code%2C%20a%20human%20developer,case%20an%20AI%20went%20off)).  
- **Delivery Lead Pod:** The Delivery Lead monitors the Dev Pod’s output to update the project status. For instance, upon code completion, the Delivery Pod will log that the development task is done and trigger a code review or testing handoff ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=%7C%20,changelog%2C%20release%20notes%29)). The Delivery Lead (or a human tech lead) may also do a quick review of the code or at least verify that all expected files were produced.  
- **Human Team (Developers/Tech Lead):** In a human-AI hybrid team, a human developer or tech lead will review the Dev Pod’s code via a pull request (see Git integration below) ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,an%20AI%20went%20off%20track)). They ensure the code meets quality and design standards. Only after human approval (or automated checks) will the code be merged and released.  
- **Project Artifacts:** The outputs (code and documentation) become part of the overall product. For example, updated specs and changelogs are later used for stakeholder communications or user documentation. The integrated codebase eventually gets deployed to end users once validated.  

## Do’s and Don’ts  

**Do:**  
- **Follow Specifications Closely:** Implement only what is described in the task spec or user story. If something is unclear or seems contradictory, flag it to the Delivery Lead rather than guessing.  
- **Keep Code Quality High:** Write clean, well-structured code. Use meaningful variable and function names. Include comments especially where logic might be non-obvious. Ensure that the code is efficient and handles edge cases that are evident from the spec.  
- **Update Related Artifacts:** When you change a function signature or data structure, immediately update any related documentation (Markdown specs, README, YAML config) so that other pods and team members have correct information ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=reference%20for%20all%20pods,The%20Hidden)). Consistency prevents miscommunication.  
- **Test Basic Scenarios:** Do a quick sanity check (manually or via a small test) of the new code if possible. For example, if you wrote a function, consider testing it with a sample input in an isolated environment to confirm it behaves as expected.  
- **Communicate Completion:** Once a task is finished, signal clearly (through the handoff log or status update) that the feature is ready for the next phase. Include references to where code was changed (e.g., file names or commit IDs) to aid the QA Pod and reviewers.

**Don’t:**  
- **Don’t Stray from the Assigned Task:** Avoid implementing extras or tangents that are not requested (“gold-plating”). Each Pod should stay in its lane – the Dev Pod writes code but doesn’t decide if a feature is done or change requirements ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=08.00352v6%23%3A~%3Atext%3DUnambiguous,agents%20from%20stepping%20on%20each)). If you see an opportunity for an unrelated improvement, note it down for future discussion (e.g., as a suggestion to the Delivery Lead or WoW Pod) rather than doing it mid-task.  
- **Don’t Neglect Backward Compatibility:** When updating interfaces or data models, don’t break existing functionality unless the change is intentional and approved. For example, if you alter a YAML config structure, ensure the rest of the system is adjusted or flag the breaking change to the team.  
- **Don’t Commit Incomplete Work:** Never mark a feature as done or initiate a pull request if significant parts are unimplemented or known bugs exist. If you are stuck or the solution is partial, inform the Delivery Lead for help or additional inputs rather than pushing half-done code.  
- **Don’t Overwrite Others’ Work Unintentionally:** When syncing with the repository, be careful to pull the latest changes. Avoid scenarios where you might undo someone else’s commit (including another AI pod’s changes) due to working on an outdated base. Always merge or rebase with the current main or feature branch as instructed.  
- **Don’t Expose Sensitive Info:** Ensure the code does not include secrets, credentials, or sensitive data in plain form. Even though AI pods shouldn’t have access to secrets by design, double-check that output doesn’t contain anything inappropriate (like printing out secure tokens) which could leak in logs or commits.

## Reusable Templates & Examples  
The Dev Pod benefits from several templates and conventions established in the project to speed up development and ensure consistency:  

- **Feature Spec Template:** All feature requirements are provided in a standardized Markdown format (in `/docs/specs/`). Each spec contains sections like *Description*, *Acceptance Criteria*, *Design Notes*, and *Open Questions* ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,An%20example)). Because the format is consistent, the Dev Pod knows where to find key details (e.g., acceptance criteria list) and can even auto-generate some code structure from it.  
- **Code Snippet Library:** Common patterns or code snippets (for example, standard functions for logging, error handling, etc.) are available so the Dev Pod doesn’t start from scratch each time. These might be in an internal wiki or in a `/docs/dev/code_patterns.md`. The Dev Pod can refer to these patterns and adapt them to the current task, ensuring reuse of proven solutions.  
- **Function Interface Templates:** If the project uses specific interface patterns (say, a typical structure for API endpoints or class definitions), those are documented. The Dev Pod may have template code for a new API handler or a new database model that it customizes per feature. This reduces omissions and aligns with system architecture.  
- **Commit Message Convention:** The project uses a template for commit messages to improve traceability. For example: `DEV: <feature-id> <short description>`. The Dev Pod should follow this, e.g., `DEV: #123 Implement scoring function for risk analysis`. This convention (including the feature or issue ID) ties the commit back to the task and makes history easy to parse.  
- **Prompt Template:** The system prompt for the Dev Pod itself is a form of template that guides its behavior. It reminds the pod to output code and a short changelog, not an essay ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L435%20the%20Dev,and%20keep%20communication%20efficient)). This ensures every output is formatted with the code first, and summary after, which all team members now expect when reviewing Dev Pod outputs.

## Git/GitHub Integration & Traceability  
**Branching Strategy:** Development work is done on isolated feature branches. The Delivery Lead (or the Dev Pod when instructed) creates a branch for the task (e.g., `feature/123-login-api`). The Dev Pod switches to this branch to implement the feature. This isolation aligns with our Git workflow: main (or `dev`) branch stays stable, while feature branches are merged after review ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,generated)). For small or urgent fixes, a hotfix branch may be used similarly.  

**Syncing Code:** Before coding, the Dev Pod ensures it has the latest code by pulling from the remote repository’s main branch (or base branch for the feature). After implementation, it adds and commits all changed files. The commit message follows the standard (as noted in templates) and includes references to the feature or issue. For example: *“DEV: Implemented feature #123 (login API) – added `login()` in `auth.py` and updated `/docs/specs/auth.md`.”* This level of detail in the commit message provides traceability.  

**Pull Requests:** After committing, the Dev Pod (via the Delivery Lead Pod or an automation) opens a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub (or the Git platform in use) for the completed feature. The PR description auto-includes the changelog or summary of changes. The Delivery Lead Pod or a human reviewer is assigned. We treat AI-generated code like any code – it goes through code review before merging ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,an%20AI%20went%20off%20track)). The QA Pod’s test results can be attached to the PR as evidence of functionality ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,an%20AI%20went%20off%20track)), which the reviewer will consider. The Dev Pod may be asked via comments to make fixes if the reviewer finds issues.  

**Merging and Tagging:** Once approved, the PR is merged into the main branch by the Delivery Lead Pod or human maintainer. The Dev Pod should then pull the latest main to stay updated. The Delivery Lead might tag a version if the feature completes a release milestone. All commits are thus recorded in project history with author (the AI agent identity) and timestamp, providing a clear trace.  

**Conflict Resolution:** If the Dev Pod’s changes conflict with others (e.g., another feature touched adjacent code), the Delivery Lead will notify the Dev Pod to resolve conflicts. The Dev Pod will get an updated diff, adjust the code, and commit a resolution. This should be done before PR merge. In case of complex conflicts, a human might assist, but the goal is to have the AI resolve straightforward merge issues (like changed line numbers or simple logic merges).  

**Traceability Links:** Every piece of output from the Dev Pod can be traced through Git history and documentation. The use of feature IDs in commit messages and branch names links the code to the user story or ticket. Additionally, the *handoff log* maintained by Delivery Lead will note that “Dev -> QA: Feature X implemented in commit `<hash>`” ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=commits%20code%2C%20a%20human%20developer,case%20an%20AI%20went%20off)). This way, anyone can follow the chain from a requirement, to code commit, to test, to release.  

**Continuous Integration (CI):** The repository is assumed to have CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) configured. When the Dev Pod pushes a commit or opens a PR, the CI runs automated checks: linters, build, and perhaps some unit tests. The Dev Pod should ensure the CI passes. If a pipeline fails (say a syntax error or a failed basic test), the Delivery Lead Pod will alert the Dev Pod to fix and push an update. Passing CI is typically required before the PR can be merged, enforcing a baseline quality.  

By following this Git/GitHub process, the Dev Pod ensures that its contributions are version-controlled, reviewed, and integrated with full visibility. This maintains **traceability** of every change from idea to implementation, a cornerstone of our AI-native development workflow ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,platform%20like%20GitHub%2C%20treat%20AI)) ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,generated)).

# QA Pod – Standard Operating Procedure

## Role & Scope  
The **QA Pod** (Quality Assurance Pod) functions as the tester and quality guardian of the AI delivery team. Its mission is to **test the application thoroughly** – verifying that new features meet acceptance criteria and that existing functionality remains unaffected ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=%7C%20,Test%20cases%20and)). The QA Pod designs and executes test cases, probes for edge cases, validates AI responses for correctness and safety, and reports any bugs or quality issues it finds ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=%7C%20,Suggestions%20for%20improving%20robustness)). In essence, it ensures the product is reliable and performs as expected, before changes progress to end-users. The QA Pod does *not* fix code or change requirements; it stays in its lane by focusing solely on validation and quality feedback.  

## Default Tasks  
- **Test Case Design:** For each new feature or change, the QA Pod creates a set of test cases. These cover normal expected behavior (per the spec’s acceptance criteria) and edge cases (unusual or extreme inputs, error conditions). If the feature involves AI outputs (e.g., an LLM responding to prompts), test cases include checking response accuracy and safety (no inappropriate content or hallucinations).  
- **Test Execution:** The QA Pod runs the application or module with the designed test cases. This may involve using an automated test framework or calling functions directly. It carefully records the actual outcomes and compares them against expected results.  
- **Regression Testing:** The pod also re-tests relevant existing features to ensure the new change didn’t break anything that was previously working. For instance, if the Dev Pod updated the login functionality, the QA Pod will also quickly check registration or other adjacent features if they might be impacted.  
- **Bug Reporting:** When a discrepancy or defect is found, the QA Pod documents it clearly. This includes steps to reproduce the issue, what it expected versus what happened, and any logs or data that help illustrate the problem. The QA Pod then communicates this to the Dev Pod (and Delivery Lead) for fixing, usually via a structured bug report.  
- **Verification & Closure:** After the Dev Pod delivers a fix for a bug, the QA Pod re-tests the scenario to confirm the fix. It marks test cases as passed and closes out the bug report if all looks good. This loop (test -> report -> fix -> re-test) continues until the feature meets the defined *Definition of Done*, e.g., all critical test cases pass and acceptance criteria are met.  
- **Quality Improvement Suggestions:** Beyond finding bugs, the QA Pod may note opportunities to improve quality, such as areas of the code that could use more error handling, or test scenarios that should be added in the future. It shares these insights (e.g., “Suggestion: add validation for email format to prevent future issues”) as part of continuous improvement, typically logging them for the WoW Pod or Delivery Lead to consider.  

## Tools & Inputs  
**Inputs:** The QA Pod receives the **Feature Spec** and any updated documentation as its primary input, which detail what the expected behavior is. It also uses the **Dev Pod’s outputs** – the new code and the accompanying notes/changelog – to understand what parts of the system changed and any special instructions (like if certain environment setup is needed to test). Test data or reference values are another input; for example, if there’s a YAML file of reference thresholds (domain rules), the QA Pod will use that to validate outcomes (ensuring the app’s outputs align with reference data) ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=prevents%20misimplementation%20and%20ensures%20QA,Because%20it%E2%80%99s%20structured)). Past bug reports or known issues are also inputs to consider (to avoid regressions).  

**Tools:** The QA Pod operates in a controlled test environment. This might be a staging instance of the app or a local environment where it can run the latest code. It uses testing frameworks as applicable (for a web app, it might use Selenium or API testing tools; for a Python library, perhaps PyTest). If the app involves AI responses, the QA Pod might use scripts to simulate user queries to the LLM and capture outputs. The QA Pod has access to logs and can enable debug modes to get more insight during testing. Additionally, it leverages automation: for example, **auto-generated test harnesses** can be created from YAML specs ([ChatGPT WoW Draft Plan.md](file://file-CzcpqxRzwdPiVpXLVizTZ6#:~:text=%F0%9F%A7%AA%20Testing%20%2F%20QA%20,for%20retraining%20or%20deeper%20probes)). If a spec provides structured scenarios, the QA Pod can turn them into automated tests quickly.  

The QA Pod also uses a **test case management system** – in our repo, this could simply be a structured Markdown or YAML file listing test cases. It might maintain a file like `/docs/qa/test_cases_<feature>.md` or a YAML with test definitions that can double as input to automated tests. This ensures tests are documented and versioned.  

## Expected Outputs  
- **Test Cases Documentation:** A clear list or table of test cases for the feature. This typically includes an identifier, a short description, the steps or input, expected result, and pass/fail status once executed. For example, the QA Pod might write a Markdown table or YAML entries for each case. *Example:*  

  ```yaml
  - id: TC_login_01
    scenario: "User logs in with correct credentials"
    steps: 
      - "Submit username 'user@example.com' and correct password"
    expected: "Login succeeds and user is directed to dashboard"
    actual: "Login succeeds and user is directed to dashboard"
    status: "pass"

  - id: TC_login_02
    scenario: "User logs in with wrong password"
    steps:
      - "Submit username 'user@example.com' and an incorrect password"
    expected: "Login fails with an 'invalid credentials' error message"
    actual: "Login failed, but no error message was shown"
    status: "fail"
  ```  

  In the above YAML, the QA Pod documents two test cases: one passed, one failed. This structured format makes it easy for the team to parse results.  

- **Bug Reports:** For any failed test (status "fail"), the QA Pod produces a bug report. If using a formal issue tracker, this might be an issue ticket; in our Git-based workflow, it can be a markdown file or an entry in a `bugs.yaml`. A bug report includes: bug ID, description, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual result, severity, and any relevant logs or screenshots. For example, a bug in Markdown might look like:  

  **Bug:** *Login error message not shown on invalid password*  
  **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. Go to the Login page.  
  2. Enter username `user@example.com` and password `wrongpassword`.  
  3. Click "Login".  
  **Expected Result:** Error message "Invalid credentials" is displayed.  
  **Actual Result:** The login fails but the user sees no error message (the form just resets).  
  **Severity:** Medium (functional issue, confusing UX).  

  The QA Pod would save this as an entry or file and notify the Dev Pod.  

- **Test Result Summary:** A summary report that aggregates the testing outcome for the feature. It might list how many test cases passed/failed and overall status (e.g., "Feature X: 10 tests run, 8 passed, 2 failed – **Not Ready**"). This could be appended to a `/docs/qa/reports.md` file for record-keeping ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=given%20access%20via%20an%20API,etc.%29%20for%20easy%20aggregation)). The Delivery Lead Pod will use this summary to update the task status. If all tests pass, the QA Pod essentially signs off the feature as *Done*.  
- **Regression Test Log:** If any regression tests were run on existing features, the QA Pod notes their status as well. Ideally, all previously working tests remain green. Any regression is treated as a bug and reported.  
- **Suggestions/Improvements:** (Optional) A section in the test report or a separate note where QA suggests improvements. For example, “The password field accepted 500 characters; perhaps we should limit length for security.” These are not bugs per se, but observations to consider. They might be turned into new backlog items by the Delivery Lead or discussed in retrospectives.  

## Execution Standards  
The QA Pod must uphold rigorous standards to ensure no critical issue slips by:  

- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Ensure test cases cover all functional requirements (each acceptance criterion has at least one test) and key edge cases. Consider boundary values, erroneous inputs, and concurrency or multi-step flows where applicable. The QA Pod should think like both a typical user and a destructive tester trying to break the system.  
- **Repeatability:** Document tests such that they can be re-run consistently. Another QA engineer or pod should be able to follow the documented steps and achieve the same results. This is crucial for regression testing later.  
- **Objectivity:** Report factual outcomes without bias. If a test fails, provide evidence (logs, specific outputs) without assumption of what went wrong – let the Dev Pod or developers determine root cause. The QA Pod’s role is to observe and report the behavior, not to debug code internally (though it can pinpoint likely problem areas).  
- **Efficiency:** While thorough, the QA Pod should also be efficient – prioritize critical tests first (smoke tests, happy path) to catch showstoppers early, then dive into detailed edge cases. In an AI-accelerated workflow, we aim to cycle quickly, so finding any major bug sooner helps the Dev Pod fix it within the same iteration.  
- **Safety Testing:** If the application involves AI model outputs (like user-facing responses), test for safety and ethical compliance. This means checking that the AI doesn’t produce disallowed content, adheres to any content guidelines, and handles prompts gracefully. This might involve injecting some potentially problematic inputs to see how the system copes. Any violation or dangerous output is treated as a critical bug.  
- **No Overlap of Roles:** The QA Pod should not attempt to fix the code or change requirements – if an issue is found that might imply a spec change (for example, spec missed a scenario), the QA Pod raises it to the Delivery Lead and WoW Pod for decision. Similarly, the QA Pod doesn’t mark a feature as accepted until all tests truly pass the agreed criteria (even if, say, a minor bug exists, QA shouldn’t waive it without explicit approval). This clarity ensures trust in the QA sign-off.  
- **Regression Mindset:** Always consider the broader system. When a new feature is tested, think about how it might affect existing features. Even if not explicitly asked, a quick regression check on related functionality is part of QA’s standard, to avoid surprises later. For instance, if a new field is added to a form, test not only the new field but make sure submission still works with old fields as before.  

## Output Locations  
QA outputs are stored in the repository for transparency and historical record, much like code:  

- **Test Cases & Results:** Saved under a QA-specific docs area, e.g., `/docs/qa/`. We might have a folder structure such as `/docs/qa/<feature>/` containing `test_cases.yaml` and `test_results.md` for that feature, or a combined report. In a simpler approach, a single `reports.md` can accumulate all testing outcomes with headings per feature. Storing in the repo ensures that anyone (including other pods) can review test scenarios ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=given%20access%20via%20an%20API,etc.%29%20for%20easy%20aggregation)).  
- **Bug Reports:** Minor bug reports can be logged in a central `bugs.md` or `bugs.yaml` in `/docs/qa/` or `/docs/`. However, for workflow, it might be better to log them as issues in the project’s issue tracker (if using GitHub, as GitHub Issues) so they can be tracked and closed. The SOP should accommodate either. If in-repo, the QA Pod appends to the bug log file; if in an external tracker, the QA Pod ensures the issue is created with all details (perhaps via an API or through the Delivery Lead Pod). In either case, each bug should have a unique identifier for reference.  
- **Automated Test Scripts:** If the QA Pod also produces automated test code (like a Python test function or a JSON file for a test runner), those should go into the code repository’s test suite directories (e.g., under `/tests/`). For example, if QA writes a new unit test for the feature, it commits it in `/tests/test_feature_xyz.py`. This way, the test becomes part of CI and future regression.  
- **Handoff/Status Updates:** The QA Pod will update the central **handoff log** or status board when it has completed testing or when it finds issues. For instance, once testing is done (pass or fail), an entry might be added to `handoff_log.yaml`: `QA -> Delivery: Feature X testing complete, 2 bugs opened` ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=handoffs%20are%20smooth,changelog%2C%20release%20notes%29)). This log (likely maintained by Delivery Pod) ensures traceability of stage transitions.  

## Output Recipients  
- **Dev Pod:** The development pod is the primary recipient of QA feedback. All bug reports and failed test details are directed to the Dev Pod for resolution. The QA Pod ensures the Dev Pod has enough information to reproduce and fix the issue. They effectively communicate through the bug tracking system or direct handoff notes.  
- **Delivery Lead Pod:** The Delivery Lead monitors QA outputs to make go/no-go decisions for promotion of the feature. The QA Pod’s summary (pass/fail) informs the Delivery Lead whether the feature can be merged/deployed or needs more work. The Delivery Lead also updates the project board using QA’s results (e.g., mark a task as “Done” if QA passed all tests, or “In Progress – Bugs Found” if not).  
- **WoW Pod:** Any patterns observed in testing (like recurring types of bugs, or gaps in specs) are of interest to the WoW Pod for process improvement. For example, if QA often finds that acceptance criteria are unclear, the WoW Pod may update the spec template to include more detail. Thus, QA shares such insights in retrospectives.  
- **Human QA Lead or Team (if applicable):** In a human+AI team, a human QA lead might oversee the QA Pod’s work. They will review test cases and results, possibly spot-checking critical scenarios to verify the AI’s testing. The documented test results in the repo allow a human to audit what QA Pod did. The human might also feed additional test cases to the QA Pod if they think of scenarios the AI missed.  
- **Stakeholders:** Indirectly, QA outputs (especially a high-level test report) might be shared with project stakeholders or attached to release notes to prove that the feature was thoroughly tested. For instance, a project manager or client might want to see a summary of testing for a milestone – the Delivery Lead could extract this from QA Pod’s reports.

## Do’s and Don’ts  

**Do:**  
- **Be Thorough and Creative:** Test not only the “happy path” but also invalid inputs, error conditions, and edge cases. Push the system’s limits where feasible (e.g., very long text input, boundary numeric values, concurrent requests) to see how it behaves. The goal is to uncover issues before users do.  
- **Document Everything:** Write down each test case and outcome. If a bug is found, document the exact steps and conditions. Good documentation allows the Dev Pod to quickly replicate the issue and shows the team the scope of testing done.  
- **Verify Acceptance Criteria:** Cross-check each acceptance criterion in the spec and make sure there is at least one test validating it. For example, if an acceptance criterion says “User must be able to reset password via email link,” ensure there’s a test for that flow and that it passes.  
- **Validate Data and AI Outputs:** If the feature deals with data processing, verify outputs against known references or calculations. If it’s an AI response, verify it makes sense given the input and is factually correct where applicable. Leverage reference files (like a YAML of expected values or thresholds) to assert correctness ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=prevents%20misimplementation%20and%20ensures%20QA,Because%20it%E2%80%99s%20structured)). The QA Pod should catch if the AI logic deviates from established data (e.g., symptom severity thresholds in `symptoms_reference.yaml` are respected).  
- **Communicate Clearly and Promptly:** As soon as a critical bug is found, raise it so the Dev Pod can start fixing. Don’t wait to finish all testing if something blocking appears early. Conversely, once all tests pass, promptly signal that QA is complete for that feature so the team can move forward. Keep the Delivery Lead in the loop especially for major issues or delays.  
- **Think Like an End-User:** Beyond formal test cases, also do exploratory testing. Simulate a real user’s perspective – is the feature intuitive? Are there any UI/UX glitches? While the focus is on functional correctness, noting usability issues (like confusing messages or slow response) is valuable. These can be fed back to improve the product quality holistically.

**Don’t:**  
- **Don’t Assume “It’s Probably Fine”:** If something looks odd or a test is inconclusive, investigate further. Don’t ignore a potential issue just because the spec didn’t mention it. For example, if after a certain sequence the system behaves slowly or a log shows an error, dig in rather than dismissing it.  
- **Don’t Alter Code or Specs:** Even if the QA Pod thinks it knows how to fix a bug, it should not modify the code or spec itself. That’s the Dev Pod’s job or the Delivery Lead’s decision. QA should strictly report issues. This separation ensures accountability and avoids the introduction of unvetted changes ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=08.00352v6%23%3A~%3Atext%3DUnambiguous,agents%20from%20stepping%20on%20each)).  
- **Don’t Overlook Re-testing:** After a bug is fixed, always re-run the relevant tests (and some regression tests around it). Never consider a bug “closed” without verification. If multiple fixes have been made, consider running a full regression of the feature.  
- **Don’t Let Pressure Skew Quality:** In rapid AI development, there may be time pressure to sign off quickly. However, the QA Pod should not mark a feature as passed if known issues are unresolved. If truly minor issues are being deferred, that decision comes from the Delivery Lead/human manager, not unilaterally from QA. QA’s credibility lies in being the strict gatekeeper of quality.  
- **Don’t Keep Findings to Yourself:** If during testing the QA Pod notices a pattern (like “we often forget to handle null inputs in many features”), do report that in the improvement suggestions. The QA Pod shouldn’t limit communication to pass/fail – systemic observations are valuable. Not reporting them would miss an opportunity to improve the overall process or code standards.  

## Reusable Templates & Examples  
- **Test Case Template:** The QA Pod follows a template for writing test cases, ensuring consistency. Each test case has fields like *Test ID*, *Scenario/Title*, *Preconditions* (if any setup is needed), *Steps*, *Expected Result*, *Actual Result*, and *Status*. For manual test documentation, a Markdown table or YAML as shown above is used. For automated tests, these cases may be parameterized in code. This template ensures no key detail (like expected outcome) is omitted.  
- **Bug Report Template:** All bug reports use a consistent structure (as exemplified in the bug report above). If using an issue tracker, the QA Pod fills in the predefined fields (title, description, steps, expected, actual, severity, etc.). If using a markdown log, it uses a consistent format with bold headings or YAML fields for each piece of info. This makes it easier for the Dev Pod to quickly parse the report and for the Delivery Lead to prioritize bugs (e.g., severity is clearly noted).  
- **Checklist for Regression:** The QA Pod maintains a checklist of high-level features or scenarios that must always work (smoke tests). Before finishing, QA quickly runs through this checklist. This could be documented in a file like `/docs/qa/regression_smoke.md`. It’s essentially a template list reused each time (e.g., “App starts without errors”, “User can log in”, “No 500 errors in logs on basic actions”, etc.).  
- **Automated Test Snippets:** There are template code snippets for tests if applicable. For example, a template for a API test might look like:  

  ```python
  def test_<feature_functionality>():
      # Setup: [..]
      result = call_function_or_api(params)
      assert result == <expected>, "Expected X but got Y"
  ```  

  The QA Pod can use these patterns to quickly write actual test code. It ensures assertions and structure are uniform across tests.  
- **Reference Data for Validation:** As part of templates, QA relies on reference data files (often prepared by the Research Pod). For instance, if validating a medical AI’s advice, a `reference_guidelines.yaml` might list safe vs unsafe recommendations. The QA Pod uses this as a template to check AI outputs. It’s not a template in the usual sense, but a shared artifact that standardizes validation. The presence of such data means the QA Pod doesn’t have to hardcode expected values; it reads from the YAML and compares app output, ensuring consistency and easy updates if the reference changes.  
- **Prompt Template (for QA Pod itself):** The system prompt guiding the QA Pod is structured to ensure it outputs test cases and results systematically ([ChatGPT WoW Draft Plan.md](file://file-CzcpqxRzwdPiVpXLVizTZ6#:~:text=%F0%9F%A7%AA%20QA%20Pod%20,observed%20vs%20expected%20results)). For example, it might instruct: “Output each test case with: ID, scenario, steps, expected, actual, result.” This internal template helps maintain the formatted output. The WoW Pod maintains such prompt templates, and the QA Pod’s behavior is thus templated and repeatable each time it runs tests.

## Git/GitHub Integration & Traceability  
While the QA Pod doesn’t produce code, it still interacts with version control for its outputs and for collaboration:  

- **Test Artifact Versioning:** The QA Pod commits its test documentation and reports to the repository. For example, after testing Feature X, it will commit `docs/qa/FeatureX_test_results.md` and perhaps `docs/qa/FeatureX_test_cases.yaml`. The commit message might be: `QA: Add test results for Feature X (2 failures reported)`. This practice version-controls the test evidence, allowing anyone to later see what was tested for that feature ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=given%20access%20via%20an%20API,etc.%29%20for%20easy%20aggregation)).  
- **Linking to Code Changes:** Ideally, the QA Pod’s test results commit or PR should reference the code commit or PR it tested. For instance, if Feature X’s code was PR #45, the QA Pod might comment on that PR with results. Alternatively, the QA Pod could include the feature/issue ID in its commit message. This way, one can navigate from a code change to its test verification.  
- **Issue Tracking and Branch Workflow:** When the QA Pod finds bugs, those bugs are tracked in the workflow. If using GitHub, for each bug the QA Pod might open a new issue (or multiple issues). Each issue can then be linked to a fix commit by the Dev Pod (e.g., “Fixes #123”). If the team uses a branch-per-bug strategy for quick fixes, the Delivery Lead might spin up a `bugfix/` branch. The QA Pod will test the fixes on that branch and close the issue when done.  
- **Pull Request Checks:** QA results are an integral part of the PR process. The Delivery Lead or CI may require that “QA approval” is given before merging. This can be formalized by the QA Pod posting a comment like “QA Passed: All tests green for this feature” on the PR, or the CI could run an automated suite that QA Pod wrote. In our process, we treat the QA Pod’s sign-off as a required check. Only when QA marks a feature as passed (either via comment or by all tests in CI passing) will the Delivery Lead merge the code.  
- **Handoff Logging:** The QA Pod updates the central log or board when testing is complete. For example, in `pod_status.yaml` (or similar), the QA Pod could mark the task as done or provide a status:  

  ```yaml
  - feature: "User Login"
    dev_status: "Complete"
    qa_status: "Failed"
    details: "2 bugs opened (#101, #102)"
    last_update: "2025-04-18T15:30Z"
  ```  

  This status entry (maintained by Delivery or QA Pod) in a YAML board gives a quick snapshot ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=%7C%20,changelog%2C%20release%20notes%29)). It’s committed to the repo so all pods and humans see it.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** When the QA Pod contributes automated tests to the repo, those get run in CI on future commits. This means that once a bug is fixed and tests pass, those tests will guard against regressions automatically. The QA Pod, in effect, adds to the suite of regression tests with each feature. The CI status is thus partially a result of QA Pod’s work. QA should monitor CI as well – if new commits trigger test failures, QA can investigate whether it's a new issue or an existing test that needs updating.  
- **Traceability:** By having test cases, results, and bug reports all checked into source control (or linked via issue IDs), we maintain an audit trail. Months later, one can answer: “Was Feature X thoroughly tested? What were the known issues?” by looking at these QA artifacts. This traceability is crucial in an AI development context to build trust – every requirement is linked to tests which are linked to outcomes, reducing the “black box” nature of AI changes.

# Research Pod – Standard Operating Procedure

## Role & Scope  
The **Research Pod** serves as the team’s knowledge engine and data analyst. Its role is to **gather information, data, and expert insights** to inform development ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=%7C%20,Structured%20data)). Whenever the team faces uncertainty – be it understanding a domain concept, choosing a technology, or finding reference values – the Research Pod steps in. It operates like an AI research analyst: fetching documentation, comparing solutions, analyzing user data or feedback, and delivering findings in a useful format. The Research Pod ensures that decisions are well-informed and that the project has access to up-to-date knowledge (domain knowledge, best practices, regulatory guidelines, etc.). It does *not* make final decisions or write production code; rather, it provides the evidence and options for the Dev or Delivery pods to act on.  

## Default Tasks  
- **Domain Research:** When developing a feature that involves domain-specific knowledge (e.g. medical rules, financial regulations, etc.), the Research Pod finds authoritative information on the topic. This could include reading articles, guidelines, or academic papers and summarizing key points relevant to the feature.  
- **Technical Stack Exploration:** If the team needs to choose a technology or solve a technical problem, the Research Pod investigates available options. For example, “What OCR library should we use for image text extraction?” The pod will compare a few libraries or services, noting their pros/cons, cost, ease of integration, and community support.  
- **Data Collection and Analysis:** The Research Pod can gather and analyze data to support development. For instance, if designing an AI model feature, it might collect sample data or metrics. Or if user testing feedback exists, the pod might aggregate common pain points. It can perform basic analysis (statistical summaries, identify trends) and present results.  
- **Spike Prototyping (Research spikes):** Occasionally, the best way to answer a question is by quick experimentation. The Delivery Lead might assign the Research Pod a “spike” task – a time-boxed mini-prototype or experiment. For example, “Test whether GPT-4 can extract entities from legal text reliably.” The Research Pod will conduct that experiment (writing a short script or prompt, running it on sample inputs) and report the findings (accuracy, issues, recommended approach).  
- **Recommendations:** Based on research findings, the pod formulates recommendations. For example, after comparing libraries, it might recommend “Library A for our use-case because it’s faster and has a compatible license.” Or it might suggest an algorithm or approach to implement a feature (e.g., “Use a transformer-based model for this NLP task as it’s shown best accuracy in literature”). These recommendations guide the Dev and Delivery Pods in decision-making.  
- **Maintain Knowledge Base:** Over time, the Research Pod curates the knowledge artifacts of the project. It might update a FAQ or glossary of terms for the domain, add entries to a reference database (YAML/JSON) that can be used by others. For example, if new domain thresholds are found (say, medical risk levels), it updates the `reference_data.yaml`. This ensures the project’s knowledge is cumulative and doesn’t get lost in past chat history.  

## Tools & Inputs  
**Inputs:** The Research Pod typically receives a **research request** or question from the Delivery Lead or another pod. This request may include context: e.g., the feature spec and the specific area that needs clarification (“We need concussion recovery stages for the Return-to-Play feature”). It may also specify a desired output format (e.g., “list the stages and criteria in YAML format”). The Research Pod also has access to any existing project documentation and prior research logs, so it doesn’t duplicate efforts. It will use the current knowledge base (like data model files, previous research summaries) as a starting point.  

**External Tools:** The Research Pod can interface with external knowledge sources. This might include internet search engines, developer documentation, academic paper databases, or internal company knowledge repositories. For instance, it could search the web for official guidelines (if allowed) or query a corporate wiki for past project insights. The pod may use APIs or scraping tools to gather data if needed (respecting access and licensing constraints). If internet access is restricted, the pod relies on a pre-provided knowledge base or requests the human to provide relevant excerpts.  

**Processing Capabilities:** The Research Pod can use its AI capabilities to summarize long text, extract structured information from unstructured data, and even perform simple calculations or code execution (if given a sandbox) for data analysis. For example, it might be given a CSV of user survey results and asked to summarize key statistics – it can load and analyze that within its environment. It may also use natural language understanding to extract key points from a document (like pulling definition of a term from a policy document).  

**Collaboration:** The Research Pod often works closely with the Dev Pod and Delivery Lead. In planning, the Delivery Lead might call on it for quick answers (research spikes) ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,code%20might%20be%20by%20roughly)). The Dev Pod might also ask for documentation (like, “find the usage of this API”). The Research Pod takes these inputs and may interact in real-time if needed, but typically it will produce a self-contained report or data file as output.

## Expected Outputs  
- **Research Reports (Markdown):** A written summary of findings on the given topic. These are usually in Markdown format for easy reading and version control. A report might include an introduction defining the question, bullet points or paragraphs summarizing key findings, tables comparing options, and references to sources. For example, a report on “OCR API Comparison” might list each API, features, pricing, pros/cons in a table, followed by a recommendation. Key sections of such a report could be **Background**, **Findings**, **Recommendation**, **Sources**.  
- **Structured Data Files:** Often the research yields data that can be directly used by the product. In those cases, the Research Pod outputs structured files like YAML or JSON. For instance, if researching “concussion return-to-play stages” for a medical app, the pod might produce a YAML file enumerating each stage, duration, allowed activities, and criteria (as it did in the `return_to_play.yaml` example). Such data files go into the repository so the Dev Pod and QA Pod can use them. For example, the YAML might look like:  

  ```yaml
  stages:
    - id: 1
      name: "Relative Rest"
      duration: "24-48 hours"
      focus: "Rest and limited movement"
      criteria_to_advance:
        - "24 hours passed"
        - "No symptom worsening"
    - id: 2
      name: "Light Aerobic Exercise"
      duration: "24 hours minimum"
      focus: "Light activity to increase heart rate slightly"
      criteria_to_advance:
        - "No symptoms with light exercise"
        - "Medical clearance if applicable"
  ```  

  This structure can be directly consumed by the application logic (and tested by QA). It was derived from domain research (e.g., medical guidelines). The **uploaded YAML file** in our project (Return-to-Play example) is an inspiration for this kind of output, showing how detailed and structured such data can be ([return_to_play.yaml](file://file-Nx3X9YHHGdvnEtwhsyHwaB#:~:text=,%22Light%20walking)) ([return_to_play.yaml](file://file-Nx3X9YHHGdvnEtwhsyHwaB#:~:text=progression_criteria%3A%20,to%20moderate%20effort%20aerobic%20exercise)).  
- **Quick Reference Sheets:** Sometimes the Research Pod outputs quick references or cheat-sheets for the developers. For example, after researching a new library, it might create a one-page Markdown with key usage examples and pitfalls for that library, so the Dev Pod can refer to it while coding. Or a glossary of domain terms (so everyone knows the definitions).  
- **Analytical Results:** If given data to analyze, the pod might output its results in a structured form. For instance, “User Feedback Analysis” might result in a Markdown with a list of top 5 requested features, or a chart (if we allow it to create images) showing a trend. Typically, in text form, it could produce a table of metrics or bullet points of insights (“80% of users found the setup easy, but 20% had trouble with login”).  
- **Recommendations & Decisions Logs:** When the Research Pod’s work leads to a decision (say the team chooses Library A), the Research Pod might document this outcome and reasoning in a decision log (for traceability). E.g., an entry in `/docs/research/decisions.md`: “*Dec 1, 2025*: Decided to use Library A for OCR. Reason: Higher accuracy in tests and compatible license ([Discovery Phase of a Project: The Practical Guide — ITRex](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/discovery-phase-of-a-project-practical-guide/#:~:text=fully,build%20your%20development%20process%20upon)).” This provides historical context for later teams on why certain tech or approach was chosen.  
- **Example Output (Research Summary):**  

  In response to a request like *“Research the best practices for CI/CD with machine learning models”*, the Research Pod might output:  

  ```markdown
  **CI/CD Best Practices for ML Models**  
  - Use separate pipelines for data preparation, model training, and application deployment.  
  - Implement automated testing for model performance (e.g., alert if accuracy drops below threshold).  
  - Employ model versioning and store models in a registry.  
  - Include a manual review step for model updates to catch ethical or bias issues.  
  **Sources:** [MLOps Guide](https://example.com/mlops), [ML CI/CD Paper](https://example.com/paper)  
  ```  

  This concise note gives actionable points plus references. The Dev or Delivery Lead Pod can take these points and integrate them into the project’s CI/CD plan.

## Execution Standards  
The quality of research is crucial as it directly impacts decisions and implementation. The Research Pod should adhere to:  

- **Credibility:** Prioritize reliable and authoritative sources. For domain knowledge, official guidelines, standards, or peer-reviewed papers are preferred. Always be wary of random forum posts or unsupported claims. If less credible sources are used (e.g., a StackOverflow answer for a code snippet), mark it as such and cross-verify if possible.  
- **Clarity and Relevance:** Summarize findings in a clear, concise manner focusing on what the team needs. Avoid dumping large raw texts. The output should be tailored: if the Dev Pod needs a specific answer, provide that answer first, then give supporting detail if needed. Use bullet points, tables, or YAML to structure information for easy digestion.  
- **Multiple Perspectives:** When applicable, provide comparative analysis. Instead of giving just one option, list alternatives and weigh them. For example, for a tooling choice, present a short comparison so the team can make an informed decision. Highlight key differences that matter to our context (e.g., if our project is small-scale, a simpler tool might be better even if a more complex one is more powerful).  
- **Accuracy and Completeness:** Ensure information is accurate and double-check critical facts. If a question remains unanswered or information is inconclusive, state that rather than guessing. It’s better to say “No definitive guideline was found for X; suggest consulting a domain expert” than to provide a potentially wrong answer.  
- **Source Tracking:** Always keep track of sources for the information gathered. In the output, include a **Sources** section or inline citations. This not only gives credit but allows others (especially humans) to verify and read more if needed. It also helps future AIs or team members trust the information.  
- **Updating Knowledge Base:** If the research finds something that updates our previous understanding (e.g., a new law that changes requirements), update the relevant documents/data in the repo. Execution isn’t done until the new knowledge is integrated into the project’s artifacts so it can be used moving forward.  
- **Time-Boxing:** Especially for research spikes or when the answer is not mission-critical, time-box the effort to avoid analysis-paralysis. The Delivery Lead might specify “spend 2 hours on this.” The Research Pod should then aim to provide the best possible findings within that time. If the question is too broad, it should focus on the most important aspects first and note what was not covered due to time.  
- **No Overstepping:** The Research Pod provides information, but does not make the final product decisions or implement features. For example, it might recommend a solution approach, but the Dev Pod and human team will decide if that’s the route to take. And it won’t directly modify code (except maybe providing example code snippets in its report if asked). This keeps a clear separation of duties.  

## Output Locations  
- **Research Documents:** All research outputs are stored under a designated research or knowledge directory in the repo, commonly `/docs/research/`. For each major research topic or request, a separate markdown file can be created, e.g., `/docs/research/ocr_options.md` or `/docs/research/concussion_stages.md`. If the research is minor or quick, it could also be logged in a cumulative `research_log.md` with dated entries.  
- **Data Files:** Structured data results (YAML/JSON) go into `/docs/data_models/` or a similar folder for data artifacts ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=prevents%20misimplementation%20and%20ensures%20QA,controllable.%20All%20such%20files%20reside)). For instance, the `return_to_play.yaml` file (in our example) would reside in `docs/data_models/return_to_play.yaml`. The naming should be clear, and if multiple related data files exist, a subfolder can be used. These files are treated as part of the codebase – versioned and reviewed.  
- **Decision Records:** If using an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) format or similar, these could be stored in `/docs/decisions/` or simply in the research reports with a clear note of the decision made.  
- **Integration with Specs:** Sometimes the research output directly updates specs. For example, if the spec had a placeholder “TBD” for a threshold value and research finds it, the Research Pod (through Delivery Lead) will update the spec file in `/docs/specs/`. This update should be clearly indicated (and ideally referenced to a source).  
- **Communication Handoff:** Major research findings should be summarized and handed off to the relevant pod. This may be via the `handoff_log.yaml` or by the Delivery Lead referencing the research doc in a task. E.g., the Delivery Lead could write in the task board: “Research Pod delivered OCR comparison (see `docs/research/ocr_options.md`) – Dev Pod to decide implementation.” The research pod itself might log something like: `Research -> Dev: Provided OCR API analysis` in the handoff record ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=%7C%20,Recommendations%20for%20implementation%20approach)).  
- **Living Knowledge Base:** The WoW Pod might decide to integrate certain research outputs into a more permanent knowledge base if they will be reused. For example, a “Glossary.md” or “Domain_knowledge.md” in docs could accumulate various research definitions. The Research Pod can update those as part of its location outputs, as instructed.  

## Output Recipients  
- **Dev Pod:** Often the immediate beneficiary of research outputs. For example, if the Dev Pod is tasked with implementing a complex algorithm, the Research Pod’s summary of the algorithm or code examples will guide the Dev Pod’s work. The Dev Pod will read the research findings to incorporate best practices or domain rules into the code.  
- **QA Pod:** Research outputs can inform testing. For instance, if the research uncovered edge cases or specified thresholds, QA will use that info to craft tests. If a data model YAML is produced (with say, symptom severity levels), the QA Pod will use that YAML to verify the app’s logic matches it. So QA consumes research artifacts to enrich its understanding of expected behavior.  
- **Delivery Lead Pod:** The Delivery Lead uses research to make planning and design decisions. For example, if research provides multiple options to proceed, the Delivery Lead (with human PM/architect) will weigh them and choose one. The Delivery Pod also uses research to refine acceptance criteria – e.g., after research, the Delivery Lead might update a user story to include a newly discovered requirement. Additionally, the Delivery Lead ensures that research outputs are reviewed if needed (especially if they involve big decisions or external content licensing etc.).  
- **Human Experts/Team:** Sometimes the research output might be for a human stakeholder. For example, the team’s human architect might review a solution architecture proposed by the Research Pod. Or a domain expert (human) might get the research summary to validate it (e.g., a doctor reviewing the medical guidelines compiled). The Research Pod’s outputs serve as a draft that a human expert can confirm or adjust, creating a collaboration.  
- **WoW Pod:** The WoW (Ways of Working) Pod might look at how information flows from research to other pods. If there’s any breakdown (like Dev Pod not using provided data properly), WoW Pod will address it. Also, if research often takes too long or yields too much info, WoW might tweak how requests are made (maybe scoping them smaller). Essentially, WoW monitors the value add of research and looks for improvements (like better templates for research output).  
- **Project Documentation:** Some research outputs (like the solution architecture, or regulatory requirements) become part of the formal project documentation that might be shared with external stakeholders or form part of a compliance audit. So indirectly, the end stakeholders or clients may receive the distilled knowledge via reports or included in an overall design document. Ensuring the research is well-documented means it can be reused in such communications.  

## Do’s and Don’ts  

**Do:**  
- **Verify from Multiple Sources:** Especially for critical information, cross-check with more than one source. For example, if determining a medical guideline, see if multiple reputable medical resources agree. This reduces the chance of acting on incorrect or biased information.  
- **Provide Context:** When delivering findings, give enough background so others understand why it matters. Don’t just drop a number or fact – frame it. E.g., “According to the standard, the safe temperature is 75°C, which means our device should shut off above that to comply.” Context ensures the team can interpret and apply the info correctly.  
- **Use Structured Formats:** Whenever possible, present information in a structured way (lists, tables, YAML). This not only makes it easier to read, but also machine-parsable if another pod wants to ingest it. For example, if you list API options in a table with columns “Name, Pros, Cons,” the Dev Pod might programmatically extract that to make a decision matrix. Structured output also minimizes ambiguity ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,endpoint%20%2Fscore%20to%20use%20calculate_score)).  
- **Keep a Trail:** Maintain a log of what research was done for future reference. This can be as simple as updating `research_log.md` with “Researched topic X on date Y – findings in file Z.” It helps avoid duplicating work and provides historical insight. If a similar question arises later, the pod or humans can revisit past research.  
- **Focus on Actionable Insights:** Tailor your output to what the team can act on. For instance, if researching user needs, highlight the needs that translate to features. If analyzing performance data, point out which bottleneck to address. The goal is not just to gather knowledge, but to make it useful for decision-making.  
- **Respect Confidentiality and IP:** If the research involves internal data or proprietary info, handle it carefully (the AI should be mindful of not leaking it). Also, note any licensing or usage restrictions of external content. For example, if recommending a library that is GPL licensed, flag that so the team knows the implications.  

**Don’t:**  
- **Don’t Overwhelm with Info:** Avoid large info dumps. The team doesn’t need a 10-page essay if a 1-page summary suffices. If you have a lot of raw data, consider moving it to an appendix or separate file and summarizing the key points up front. The pods and humans have limited bandwidth; focus on quality over quantity of information.  
- **Don’t Give Unsubstantiated Advice:** If recommending something, base it on evidence or logical reasoning. Don’t say “We should do X” without backing. If evidence is weak or it’s a hunch, be transparent about it (“Recommendation based on limited data or assumption, needs validation”). The team must trust that research outputs are unbiased and grounded.  
- **Don’t Alter Requirements on Your Own:** If research reveals something that impacts the project scope (e.g., a regulatory requirement we missed), don’t directly change the spec or backlog. Instead, report it to the Delivery Lead and suggest the change. The product direction is decided by PM/Delivery (with input from research), not by the Research Pod alone.  
- **Don’t Plagiarize:** When pulling text from sources, either quote and cite it, or paraphrase. Do not lift large verbatim passages into our docs without acknowledgment. Not only is it unethical, it could pose legal issues. The Research Pod should synthesize information in its own words or clearly mark quotations, maintaining professional standards of attribution.  
- **Don’t Remain in a Silo:** If unsure about what exactly to research or if the findings seem contradictory, reach out (via Delivery Lead) for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if two sources conflict, the Research Pod can ask a human expert or at least flag the conflict to be resolved by discussion. Similarly, if a research task is too broad, ask for refinement. Collaboration is better than going down the wrong rabbit hole.

## Reusable Templates & Tools  
- **Research Request Template:** Often the Delivery Lead will format requests in a consistent way so the Research Pod knows what to deliver. For example, a YAML or Markdown template like:  

  ```yaml
  request_id: R123
  topic: "OCR API Comparison"
  context: "Need to extract text from images in mobile app"
  deliverable: "Compare at least 3 OCR solutions (tesseract, Google Vision, Azure OCR) on cost, accuracy, ease of use"
  due_by: "2025-05-01"
  ```  

  The Research Pod can receive such structured input, which makes it clear what to focus on. This template for requests ensures no crucial info is missing (e.g., which options to consider, what criteria matter).  
- **Research Report Template:** For outputs, the Research Pod can use a standard Markdown template. For instance:  

  ```markdown
  # Research: <Topic>
  **Question:** <The question we aim to answer>  
  **Context:** <Brief context>  

  ## Findings  
  - **Point 1:** ...  
  - **Point 2:** ...  

  ## Options  
  1. **Option A:** ... (Pros/Cons, maybe a table)  
  2. **Option B:** ...  

  **Recommendation:** <if applicable>  

  **Sources:**  
  - <Source 1 reference>  
  - <Source 2 reference>  
  ```  

  This structure helps the Research Pod organize information logically. It starts with the question, then the findings (facts), then options and recommendation if it’s that type of research, and sources at end. Not all research will have options/recommendation (some is just factual), so the template is adjusted as needed.  
- **Data Template:** If certain kinds of data are frequently produced, templates are defined. For example, a YAML template for a list of domain parameters might be:  

  ```yaml
  - name: <Parameter Name>
    description: <What it is>
    value: <Recommended Value>
    source: <Source or rationale>
  ```  

  The Research Pod can fill this in for things like “system configuration values research” or “thresholds research”. Including a source or rationale in the data file can be useful for future reference (or for QA to validate against source).  
- **Literature Review Matrix:** For academic research, a template table might be used to summarize papers or articles. Columns could be: Reference, Method/Approach, Key result, Relevance to our project. The Pod can fill this for 5-10 sources quickly, giving a snapshot of knowledge landscape.  
- **Tooling:** The Research Pod likely has access to a suite of tools like a search utility or maybe a browser plugin (simulated via the orchestrator). It should also maintain a list of trusted sites or references (perhaps in `docs/research/resources.md`) – e.g., official docs links, known good blogs – as a quick go-to list. This is less a template and more a curated resource that the Pod reuses.  
- **Previous Findings Repository:** Over time, the project can accumulate research on various topics. The Research Pod template might first check if `docs/research/<topic>.md` already exists. If it does, perhaps update it rather than create anew. This reuse ensures continuity. The WoW Pod might even maintain an index of research topics so far.  

## Git/GitHub Integration & Traceability  
- **Branch for Research Outputs:** Research outputs, especially if they are needed immediately by Dev/QA, can often be added in the same feature branch that requested them. For example, if the Dev Pod is working on feature branch `feature/abc` and realizes they need a data file from research, the Delivery Lead might direct the Research Pod to also commit to that branch (`docs/data_models/new_data.yaml`). This way, the Dev Pod can use it immediately. Otherwise, research docs can go to a `research` branch or directly to main if they are more standalone. In any case, use normal Git procedures: commit with message like `RESEARCH: Added return_to_play.yaml with concussion recovery stages` including perhaps the task ID.  
- **Pull Request Review:** Significant research that influences product decisions might be reviewed by a human or relevant expert. For instance, if the Research Pod produces a solution architecture diagram/description, the lead engineer might want to review that. Using GitHub, the Research Pod can open a PR for the doc, assign the human or Delivery Lead, and after some discussion (comments on the PR), it gets merged. This formalizes the acceptance of research findings into the project record.  
- **Linking Issues or Tasks:** If the project uses a tracker for tasks, a research task would be one of them (e.g., Jira ticket or GitHub issue “Research OCR options”). The Research Pod should reference that in its commit (e.g., “Resolves #45” in commit message if #45 was the research task). This closes the loop that the task was completed and ties the deliverable (the doc/data) to the task.  
- **Version Control for Data Changes:** When research updates a data model YAML that the application uses, treat it like a code change. This means documenting the change, maybe even incrementing a version number if the format changed. The commit could mention if it’s a backward-compatible update or not. For example: “Updated thresholds in symptoms_reference.yaml (raised concussion Grade1 threshold from 5 to 6).” The Delivery Lead and Dev Pod then know to check if code logic needs to adjust. Keeping diff history of such files is crucial; if later the app behaves differently, one can trace it to “oh, the reference data was updated on that date.”  
- **Knowledge Base Maintenance:** Over the project, some research docs might become obsolete or consolidated (maybe in a Wiki or final documentation). The Research Pod, in collaboration with WoW, should archive or note deprecation of outdated info. This could be via git (move file to an archive directory or add a note at top “Superseded by newer research in X”). Traceability means even outdated research isn’t lost; it’s still in history if needed, but clearly marked so no one follows it by mistake.  
- **Communication of Availability:** When research outputs are merged, the Delivery Lead should inform relevant pods (though if they watch main branch, they’ll see new docs). Possibly a tag or release of “knowledge base v1.0” if a lot of research was done upfront. However, in practice, just linking the file in the next pod’s instructions suffices (e.g., Delivery Pod says to Dev Pod: “Refer to `concussion_stages.yaml` from research for the logic”).  
- **Audit and Compliance:** If the project requires citing sources (e.g., for regulatory reasons), having the sources listed in research documents is useful. In Git, those citations remain for audit. If needed, the team can produce a bibliography of sources used in building the product. Each research commit can be seen as an audit entry of “we consulted these external references”. This is an advantage of keeping research in-repo rather than ephemeral conversations.  

By tightly integrating research tasks into our Git workflow, we ensure that knowledge doesn’t vanish – it’s stored, versioned, and linked to the features it influences. This traceability from requirement → research → decision → implementation is part of our AI-native approach to maintain **transparency and justification** for why the AI team does what it does ([Discovery Phase of a Project: The Practical Guide — ITRex](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/discovery-phase-of-a-project-practical-guide/#:~:text=fully,build%20your%20development%20process%20upon)) ([Discovery Phase of a Project: The Practical Guide — ITRex](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/discovery-phase-of-a-project-practical-guide/#:~:text=match%20at%20L700%20Discovery%20deliverables,strategic%20decisions%20are%20considered%20and)).

# Delivery Lead Pod – Standard Operating Procedure

## Role & Scope  
The **Delivery Lead Pod** acts as the Project Manager and DevOps integrator of the AI-driven team. Its role is to **orchestrate the pods and drive the project forward** ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=%7C%20,changelog%2C%20release%20notes%29)). This pod is responsible for breaking down work, assigning tasks to the appropriate pods, tracking progress, and ensuring all pieces come together. It manages the development lifecycle from planning to release, maintaining a holistic view of the project status at all times. Additionally, it handles operational aspects like version control coordination, CI/CD pipeline monitoring, and deployment, effectively bridging the gap between development and delivery (hence the dual PM/Ops nature). The Delivery Lead Pod does not produce feature code or test cases itself; rather, it enables and coordinates the Dev, QA, Research, and WoW pods (and human inputs) to work in concert. It’s akin to a Scrum Master + Release Manager in agile terms, ensuring the team follows process and meets goals.  

## Default Tasks  
- **Task Breakdown & Assignment:** In sprint planning or whenever a new feature is approved, the Delivery Lead Pod takes high-level user stories or objectives and breaks them into concrete tasks for each pod ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,given%20a%20story%20%E2%80%9CAdd%20social)). For example, a user story “Add social login” might be broken down into: Dev task to implement OAuth, QA task to test Google/Facebook login, Research task to check OAuth best practices. The Delivery Pod then explicitly delegates these tasks, providing each pod with the necessary context to start (often via the prompt or a tasks YAML listing sub-tasks ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,endpoint%20%2Fscore%20to%20use%20calculate_score))).  
- **Coordination & Handoff Management:** As work progresses, the Delivery Lead monitors when one pod finishes and another needs to pick up. It maintains a **handoff log** of what output went from which pod to which ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=handoffs%20are%20smooth,changelog%2C%20release%20notes%29)). For instance, once the Dev Pod finishes a feature, the Delivery Lead will ensure the QA Pod is notified and given the latest code/spec to test. It sequences tasks to minimize idle time – possibly overlapping where safe (e.g., Research Pod can work on something for next sprint while Dev/QA handle current sprint).  
- **Project Tracking:** The pod keeps an up-to-date view of all tasks, their status, and any blockers. This can be via a task board or a YAML/Markdown status file. It regularly updates this “source of truth” so that at any given moment, one can see which features are in progress, which are done, which are waiting on something. It may use statuses like ToDo/In Progress/Done, or more granular (Dev Done, QA Pending, etc.). This is similar to maintaining a Kanban or sprint board, but in a format all pods can read.  
- **Progress Reporting:** The Delivery Lead Pod generates progress summaries for the team. For example, daily stand-up updates: it can compile a brief report like “Features X and Y are in QA, Feature Z development is 50% done, no blockers except waiting on research for Feature W” and share that with the human team ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=approach%20to%20take,which%20features)). It also prepares sprint review reports or release notes by gathering outputs from other pods (changelogs from Dev, test results from QA) and formatting them for stakeholder consumption.  
- **Quality Gatekeeping:** While QA Pod does testing, the Delivery Lead Pod enforces quality gates in the process. It ensures that no code is merged to main without QA sign-off and necessary reviews ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,an%20AI%20went%20off%20track)). It might automatically prevent a release if critical bugs are open. Essentially, it monitors the Definition of Done for each item – making sure all criteria (code, test, docs, review) are met before calling something “done.”  
- **DevOps & Release Management:** The Delivery Lead oversees the CI/CD pipeline. It ensures that the continuous integration jobs run after commits and that any failures are addressed (if a test fails, it flags QA/Dev; if a lint fails, it flags Dev). When a feature or a set of features is complete, the Delivery Lead coordinates merging into main, tagging a release, and deploying to the target environment. It may trigger automated deployment scripts or, if manual steps are needed, prompt a human ops to run them. The Delivery Pod also maintains environment configuration, ensuring that what Dev did works in staging/production. If something goes wrong in deployment, it works with Dev/QA to troubleshoot or rollback.  
- **Risk & Issue Management:** If any risks or impediments arise (e.g., “the API limit might throttle our feature” or “QA found a blocker bug late”), the Delivery Lead logs these and works to mitigate them. It might reprioritize tasks on the fly, escalate to human stakeholders for decisions, or allocate a pod to address the risk (like ask Research Pod to find a workaround). It keeps a risk register (especially capturing technical risks or dependencies) and ensures the team has plans for them.  
- **Documentation & Traceability:** The Delivery Lead ensures that all outputs are properly documented and linked. It might integrate documentation updates from Dev, QA, Research into the main docs and ensure consistency. It also might maintain the master changelog or release notes as mentioned, collating all contributions into a cohesive document for each release. Traceability wise, it ensures that every feature implemented can be traced back to a story or requirement, and forward to code changes and tests (often via the task board and commit linking).  

## Tools & Inputs  
**Inputs:**  
- **Product Backlog/User Stories:** The Delivery Lead Pod starts with the list of features or user stories, typically provided by the human Product Owner or discovered during the Discovery phase. These high-level items are its input to plan sprints or tasks. Each item includes description, priority, and acceptance criteria (from specs).  
- **Project Plan & Timelines:** It is aware of deadlines, sprint schedules, and key milestones. For example, knowing that a release is planned in 2 weeks influences how it prioritizes and paces tasks.  
- **Pod Status & Outputs:** The Delivery Lead constantly takes in the outputs and status updates from all other pods. It reads the Dev Pod’s commit/changelog notes, the QA Pod’s test reports, Research Pod’s findings, and WoW Pod’s process suggestions. All these are inputs to adjust the plan. For instance, if QA finds many bugs, Delivery might extend the testing period or de-prioritize starting a new feature.  
- **Handoff Log / Status Board:** The Delivery Pod itself maintains these, but they also serve as input reflecting current state. It will read the `pod_status.yaml` or equivalent to decide next actions each day ([ChatGPT WoW Draft Plan.md](file://file-CzcpqxRzwdPiVpXLVizTZ6#:~:text=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20Multi,helps%20triage%20between%20pods)). If a handoff log entry says “Dev -> QA: Feature X ready”, the Delivery Pod knows to ensure QA picks it up, etc.  
- **CI/CD Feedback:** Pipeline results (build success, test pass/fail, code coverage, etc.) are inputs. If a build fails, that’s an input for Delivery to create a task (Dev fix build). If test coverage is dropping, input to discuss in retro or prompt QA to add tests.  
- **Human Instructions:** The human project manager or tech lead may give the Delivery Pod directives, especially in exceptional cases. For instance, “De-scope Feature Y from this release” or “High priority bug came from production, address ASAP.” The Delivery Pod will incorporate these instructions into the plan (perhaps creating new tasks or reshuffling work).  
- **Tools:**  
  - **Task Tracking System:** The Delivery Pod may use an internal representation of a Kanban board or backlog. This could be a YAML file (e.g., `project_board.yaml`) or integration with an external tool (like Jira via API). For our context, we assume a simple file-based tracking in the repo for transparency to all pods.  
  - **Version Control (Git):** As a tool, the Delivery Pod interacts a lot with Git. It creates branches, merges PRs, and tags releases. It might use Git commands via an API integration.  
  - **CI/CD Dashboard:** The Delivery Pod monitors a CI dashboard (like Jenkins console or GitHub Actions page) for build/test status. It may also retrieve artifact links (like a test coverage report) to ensure quality.  
  - **Communication Channels:** Possibly, the Delivery Pod has means to send notifications – e.g., post a summary to a Slack channel or email. In our doc context, we can assume updates are written to files or the chat with the human, but conceptually it could interface with project communication tools to post daily updates or alerts.  
  - **Deployment Tools:** Scripts or cloud APIs to deploy the application (Docker registries, Kubernetes, etc.). The Delivery Pod might run these or coordinate their execution.  
  - **Monitoring Tools:** Post-deployment, it might even glance at monitoring or logging systems to verify everything is running smoothly (this might be more human, but an AI pod could be set to check a health endpoint or metric after deployment and report back).  

## Expected Outputs  
- **Project Status Board / Dashboard:** A living artifact that reflects the state of the project. This could be a Markdown or YAML file enumerating each feature or task and its status. For example, a section in the status board might look like:  

  ```yaml
  Feature: Social Login
  status: "In QA"
  assignee: "QA Pod"
  branch: "feature/social-login"
  updated: "2025-04-18"
  notes: "Dev done, two minor bugs found"
  
  Feature: Profile Settings
  status: "In Development"
  assignee: "Dev Pod"
  branch: "feature/profile-settings"
  updated: "2025-04-18"
  notes: "Dev implementing, waiting on Research for encryption guidelines"
  ```  

  This YAML snippet (or it could be a Markdown table) gives a quick overview. The Delivery Lead updates this as things change. Other pods read it to know overall progress and where they might be needed next.  
- **Handoff Log:** A chronological log of handoffs and significant events. Example entries:  

  ```yaml
  - timestamp: "2025-04-18T10:00Z"
    from: Dev Pod
    to: QA Pod
    item: "Feature Social Login completed implementation. Branch: feature/social-login."
  - timestamp: "2025-04-18T15:00Z"
    from: QA Pod
    to: Dev Pod
    item: "Bug #101 opened for Social Login (password field issue)."
  - timestamp: "2025-04-18T18:00Z"
    from: Dev Pod
    to: QA Pod
    item: "Bug #101 fixed. Please retest on branch feature/social-login."
  ```  

  This structured log (perhaps stored in `docs/wow/handoff_log.yaml`) captures the interactions between pods and serves as a source of truth for what has happened ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,Each%20entry)). It’s invaluable for traceability and debugging process issues (e.g., if a handoff was missed, we can see where it stopped).  
- **Sprint Plan / Backlog Documents:** At the start of an iteration, the Delivery Lead Pod might output a sprint plan, listing which features or tasks are in scope, who will handle them, and any goals. For example, a `Sprint_2_plan.md` could list features A, B, C, with Dev->QA->Done flow, and maybe known risks to watch. Similarly, it may maintain the product backlog file with all pending items and their priorities (if not using an external system).  
- **Release Artifacts:** When a set of features is completed, the Delivery Pod produces release notes and/or a packaged release. Release notes (as a Markdown doc or an update to `CHANGELOG.md`) summarize what’s new, improved, and fixed in this release ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,platform%20like%20GitHub%2C%20treat%20AI)). Example:  

  ```markdown
  ## [v1.2.0] - 2025-04-20
  **New Features:**
  - Social Login (GitHub & Google) added for faster onboarding.
  - Profile Settings page to manage user info and preferences.
  
  **Improvements:**
  - Updated UI for login and registration.
  
  **Fixes:**
  - Fixed memory leak in data processing module.
  - Corrected typo in FAQ.
  ```  

  The Delivery Lead compiles this from the Dev Pod’s changelogs and QA’s bug list. It ensures it’s written in a human-friendly way for stakeholders. Additionally, a packaged release might be created (e.g., a zip or Docker image) and the Delivery Pod would note its location (like “Docker image v1.2.0 pushed to registry”).  
- **Integration of Outputs:** The Delivery Lead doesn’t produce code or docs from scratch, but one of its “outputs” is the *integrated codebase*. It merges the Dev Pod’s code, the QA Pod’s test scripts, the Research Pod’s data, and WoW Pod’s process docs into one coherent repository. So, one could say a tangible output is the updated main branch after a feature and the deployed application in an environment.  
- **Alerts/Notifications:** If something goes wrong or if a decision is needed, the Delivery Lead outputs an alert. For example, if QA found a critical bug that will delay release, the Delivery Pod might output (in a status report or as a direct message to human) an alert: “🚩 *Release Blocker:* Feature X has a critical issue causing crashes. Release will be postponed until fixed.” Similarly, it might flag if a pod is waiting on something too long (“Research input needed for Feature Y – causing delay”).  
- **Process Adjustments:** Occasionally, the Delivery Lead might output suggestions on process in real-time (though this might overlap with WoW Pod). For instance, if it notices that every handoff from Dev to QA is missing an updated spec file, it might note: “Observation: Spec updates are lagging. Consider enforcing spec review before QA starts.” This could be logged for the WoW Pod to address in retro, but it shows Delivery’s oversight role.  

## Execution Standards  
To effectively manage the project, the Delivery Lead Pod adheres to strict standards of operation:  

- **Single Source of Truth:** Maintain one authoritative view of project status (like the status board file) and keep it updated. All pods and humans should be able to consult this to know the state. The Delivery Pod updates this immediately upon changes (task completed, new bug, etc.), minimizing divergence between reality and the plan.  
- **Timeliness:** Act promptly on pod outputs. For example, when Dev finishes a feature, do not delay in assigning it to QA. When QA finds a bug, prioritize it into Dev’s queue quickly. The Delivery Lead should be highly responsive, almost in real-time, to keep the pipeline flowing. This reduces wait times and idle gaps, capitalizing on AI’s speed.  
- **Prioritization:** Always be clear on priority of tasks, and communicate it. If multiple tasks are ongoing, ensure the pods know which one is higher priority if there's a conflict. If a critical bug from production appears, reorder tasks so it’s addressed immediately. The Delivery Pod should use priority labels (High/Med/Low) in the board or explicitly state them in assignments.  
- **Quality Assurance:** Enforce the Definition of Done. Do not mark a feature as done or merge code until it has met all criteria: passing tests, documentation updated, approvals don ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=velocity%20may%20be%20higher%20but,the%20human%20will%20later%20verify))】. If any criteria is not met, the Delivery Pod keeps the task open and communicates what is missing. This standard prevents half-baked work from slipping through.  
- **Risk Management:** Continuously monitor for risks or blockers. If any are identified, log them and proactively address them. For instance, if research is taking too long and could delay development, the Delivery Lead might decide to stub a feature or find a temporary assumption to keep dev moving. Document such decisions and revisit them. Never ignore risks; always have an action or contingency for each (even if it’s to accept a delay).  
- **Communication Clarity:** The Delivery Lead communicates in clear, structured updates (often bullet points or lists in reports). Avoid ambiguity – e.g., instead of saying “Feature A almost done”, say “Feature A 90% done, pending QA of last component.” Use quantifiable or specific terms. This clarity is crucial for an AI/human team to stay synchronized.  
- **Collaboration and Empowerment:** While orchestrating, the Delivery Lead should empower each pod to do its job. That means ensuring they have the inputs needed (specs, data, etc.), which might involve checking that, for example, the Research Pod delivered the YAML before Dev starts coding that part. It also means not micromanaging the pods beyond what’s necessary – trust the Dev Pod to implement, the QA Pod to test, etc., intervening only if deviations occur or if context is missing. Essentially, set them up for success and then get out of the way until they’re done or need something.  
- **Adaptability:** If the plan needs to change (which is common in agile), the Delivery Pod adapts quickly. For example, if a feature is proving more complex, maybe split it into two; if a new requirement emerges, slot it in based on priority; if team capacity changes, reassign tasks. Do this transparently – update the board, inform pods of the changes, and ensure everyone is aligned on the new plan.  
- **Documentation:** Document decisions and changes. If scope or priority changes, note it (perhaps in a “changes” section of the sprint plan or as a comment in the status file). This creates a paper trail of why we did things, useful for retrospectives and accountability. The Delivery Pod’s actions should be traceable – e.g., linking a change in plan to a directive from a stakeholder.  

## Output Locations  
- **Project Board/Status File:** Stored in the repo, likely under `/docs/wow/` or a project management folder. For example, `docs/wow/project_status.yaml` or `sprint_2_status.md`. It could also be split: one file per sprint or one file for backlog and one for in-progress. The location is known to all pods as the main index of tasks.  
- **Handoff Log:** Stored in `/docs/wow/handoff_log.yaml` as mentioned, or a similar location. Possibly one log per sprint if it gets too large, or continuous with timestamps.  
- **Changelog & Release Notes:** The `CHANGELOG.md` might live at root or in `/docs/`. Release-specific notes could be in `/docs/releases/v1.2.0.md` or just encompassed by the changelog. The Delivery Pod updates these in place, and when releasing, tags the version in git.  
- **Backlog File:** If using a file to track the backlog of future items (instead of an external tool), it could be `/docs/wow/backlog.md` or `product_backlog.yaml`. This includes all not-started items, possibly with priority and rough estimates. The Delivery Pod keeps this groomed (with input from human PM). Once items move into a sprint, they get copied into the active board/status file.  
- **Risk Register:** If maintained, likely in `/docs/wow/risks.md` or `risks.yaml`. The Delivery Pod would update this whenever a new risk is identified or an old one is mitigated. Fields could include description, likelihood, impact, owner (who will address), mitigation strategy. This is accessible to WoW Pod and humans for oversight.  
- **CI/CD Configs:** The Delivery Pod might maintain certain config files, like a `ci.yaml` or docker config, etc., usually under repo config or ops directories. If it updates those (say to add a new test step), it commits to those locations.  
- **Deployment Logs:** If the Delivery Pod executes a deployment, it might log the outcome in a deploy log (maybe in `/docs/ops/deploy_log.md` or just comment in the release notes “Deployed to staging at X time, to production at Y time”). These logs ensure operations steps are recorded.  
- **Announcements:** When major transitions happen (like a release), the Delivery Pod might output an announcement in the changelog or separate file, as mentioned. If using an external comm channel, that’s outside the repo, but within the repository context, it could update a “Latest release status” in the README or a badge if integrated.  

## Output Recipients  
- **All Pods (Team):** The status updates and task assignments are consumed by all pods. Dev Pod looks at the board to know what to work on next, QA Pod sees what’s coming down the pipe, etc. The handoff log is read by pods to make sure they didn’t miss any notification (though ideally tasks are pushed to them). Essentially, the Delivery Pod’s outputs are the coordination glue that every pod follows.  
- **Human Project Manager/Product Owner:** The Delivery Lead Pod’s reports (daily summaries, sprint plans, and release notes) are directed to the human leadership as well. They use these to understand progress and make decisions (e.g., adjust scope or confirm release readiness). For example, a human PM will read the sprint status to ensure things are on track or decide to swap priorities if needed.  
- **Stakeholders/Clients:** High-level outputs like release notes and possibly sprint review summaries are for stakeholders. The Delivery Pod helps prepare these, which might be directly shared with a client or kept for internal record. In an AI-collab environment, the human in the loop likely reviews these before distribution, but the content largely comes from what the Delivery Pod collated.  
- **WoW Pod:** The WoW Pod reviews how the process is functioning. It will look at the handoff log and status board after a sprint to analyze where bottlenecks occurred (e.g., if a lot of tasks were stuck “In QA” for long, or if handoff timings show delays). The Delivery Pod’s meticulous records enable the WoW Pod to suggest improvements. Also, if the Delivery Pod had to adjust process on the fly (like it noticed a spec was unclear and paused dev), WoW Pod would formalize any lessons (maybe update how specs are written to avoid that in future).  
- **DevOps Engineers/Ops Team (if any):** In some scenarios, there might be a human Ops or DevOps engineer overseeing production. The Delivery Pod’s deployment reports and risk log (with things like “need to scale DB for new feature”) would be important to them. They might use that info to prepare infra or be on standby for releases.  
- **Compliance/Audit:** If the project is in a regulated domain, the Delivery Pod’s logs and status could be used in audits to demonstrate a controlled process (e.g., “each feature is tested and reviewed before release; see log entry X on date Y approving feature Z”). Thus the outputs serve not just immediate team, but organizational governance needs.

## Do’s and Don’ts  

**Do:**  
- **Keep Everyone Aligned:** Constantly ensure that all team members (pods and humans) have a shared understanding of goals and status. Confirm that pods received their inputs. For example, after handing off to QA, double-check QA picked it up or acknowledged. Summaries should be broadcast so no one is out of the loop.  
- **Be Proactive:** Anticipate what pods will need ahead of time. If Dev is finishing a feature, prepare QA by maybe having test data ready or ensure the environment is up-to-date for QA. If a deadline is next week, start preparing release notes and deployment scripts now. Don’t wait for tasks to pile up; smooth the path in advance.  
- **Enforce Process Discipline:** Ensure that pods follow the SOPs (including this one). If the Dev Pod forgot to update a spec, catch it and push back: “Dev Pod, please update the spec per SOP before handing to QA.” This consistency keeps quality high. Similarly enforce branching, PR review, test completion, etc. The Delivery Pod is the guardian of the process.  
- **Use Automation:** Where possible, offload routine checks to automation. For instance, set up a bot or CI check to update the status board automatically when a PR is merged. Or use scripts to generate the daily status summary from the status file. The Delivery Pod can script itself via the AI’s capabilities to reduce manual bookkeeping, focusing more on decision-making.  
- **Keep an Eye on the Big Picture:** Amidst managing daily tasks, remember the end goals. Regularly revisit the project timeline and roadmap. Ensure that the current tasks ladder up to the release or product objectives. If not, question why certain tasks are being done. The Delivery Lead should prevent scope drift by always tying work back to the intended value.  
- **Facilitate Human-AI Collaboration:** Encourage human input at key points. For example, schedule a review (with a human) of the work done at end of sprint. Or ask for a human decision on a trade-off that AI might not have context for (like “Should we cut feature X to meet the deadline?”). This engagement ensures the AI pods remain aligned with business priorities and that the human team trusts the process.  

**Don’t:**  
- **Don’t Overallocate or Overwhelm Pods:** Avoid assigning too many tasks at once, especially if they depend on each other. AI pods can work fast, but even they have a limit in context and focus. If the Dev Pod is given 5 features in parallel, quality will suffer. It’s better to prioritize and maybe stagger start times if needed. Manage WIP (work in progress) limits akin to Kanban – finish some tasks before pulling in more.  
- **Don’t Neglect Completed Items:** Once a feature is done and released, don’t just forget about it. Ensure it’s properly closed out – documentation finalized, any lessons learned captured (maybe add to WoW Pod’s retrospective notes), and monitor it post-release for any incident. Completed doesn’t mean ignore; watch for any fallout or user feedback and be ready to loop it back into the backlog if needed.  
- **Don’t Hide Problems:** If the project is slipping or a serious issue arises, the Delivery Pod must not mask it with optimistic updates. Be transparent in reporting: e.g., “Feature A is delayed due to unresolved bug. This impacts our timeline.” Hiding or sugar-coating issues will prevent the team from reacting appropriately (like getting extra help or cutting scope). The Delivery Pod should surface issues clearly and promptly.  
- **Don’t Bypass Quality or Process Gates:** In crunch times, there might be pressure to skip steps (like “just merge the code, we’ll test in prod”). The Delivery Pod should resist this unless explicitly authorized by a human after weighing consequences. Skipping QA or rushed deployments tend to cause bigger problems later. The SOPs exist for a reason; adhere to them, and if a one-time exception is needed, get proper sign-off and document it.  
- **Don’t Micro-manage or Do Others’ Work:** The Delivery Pod shouldn’t itself try to fix code or write tests or do research – that’s for respective pods. Trust the division of labor. Overstepping could lead to confusion or suboptimal results (AI pods performing tasks they aren’t specialized for). If Delivery sees something wrong in code, it should request Dev Pod or a human to handle it, rather than editing the code itself (unless it’s minor and agreed). This keeps accountability clear.  
- **Don’t Overlook Team Morale and Workflow:** Although an AI, the Delivery Pod should be aware of the “morale” or momentum of the team. If a particular pod is struggling (maybe lots of back-and-forth on one feature), consider giving it a break or a simpler task next to regain momentum. Similarly, celebrate wins in reports (“All tests passed – great job Dev and QA pods!”). This isn’t a typical AI concern, but since humans are involved and even AI pods perform better with positive feedback loops, it’s worth noting. The Delivery Pod is the leader; leadership includes motivation and support, not just task assigning.

## Reusable Templates & Systems  
- **Task YAML Template:** The Delivery Lead often communicates tasks in structured form. For instance, a template for assigning tasks to pods:  

  ```yaml
  - task: "Implement Social Login"
    pod: "Dev"
    spec: "docs/specs/social_login.md"
    branch: "feature/social-login"
    due: "2025-04-17"
  - task: "Test Social Login"
    pod: "QA"
    depends_on: "Implement Social Login"
    due: "2025-04-18"
  ```  

  This template ensures every task has a clear description, assigned pod, references to relevant docs/branches, and due dates or dependencies. The Delivery Pod can generate such a list at sprint start and update it as tasks progress. It’s essentially a backlog in data form.  
- **Stand-up Update Template:** For daily progress updates, the Delivery Pod can use a consistent format, for example:  

  ```markdown
  **Daily Update (2025-04-18):**  
  - Feature A: Dev ✅ done, in QA (2 test cases failing, fixes in progress).  
  - Feature B: Dev in progress (60%, expected by EOD). No blockers.  
  - Research: Completed analysis for Feature C, ready for Dev.  
  - Risks/Blockers: Awaiting API keys from client for Feature D (could delay testing).  
  ```  

  This template hits all key points: status of each item and any risks. Reusing this format daily helps stakeholders quickly find info.  
- **Meeting Agenda/Notes Template:** If the Delivery Pod facilitates a sprint planning or retro (with human involvement), it can prepare notes in a template: agenda points, discussions, outcomes. E.g., for a retrospective:  

  ```markdown
  **Retrospective Sprint 2**  
  What went well:  
  - Delivery: All features delivered on time.  
  - Quality: Zero critical bugs in production.  

  What can be improved:  
  - Communication: Missed notifying Dev Pod about last-minute requirement change (caused rework).  
  - Process: Research Pod outputs came late; plan research tasks one sprint ahead.  

  Action Items:  
  - WoW Pod to update communication protocol for requirement changes.  
  - Delivery Pod to incorporate research tasks in Sprint 3 planning proactively.  
  ```  

  The Delivery Pod would share these with the WoW Pod and human team. While this leans into WoW’s territory, Delivery often contributes factual data to retrospectives and ensures the action items are fed into the next cycle’s plan.  
- **Risk Matrix Template:** As part of risk management, a template table or YAML for risks:  

  ```yaml
  - risk: "Third-party API rate limit might hinder feature X"
    likelihood: "Medium"
    impact: "High"
    mitigation: "Cache responses; monitor usage; have fallback message if limit exceeded"
    owner: "Delivery/Dev"
  ```  

  The Delivery Pod fills this as risks come up. Reviewing this regularly and updating status (e.g., if mitigated or if became an issue) is part of its duty.  
- **Definition of Done Checklist:** Possibly a template that the Delivery Pod uses to verify completeness of each task:  
  - [ ] Code merged to main  
  - [ ] All tests (unit/integration) passed  
  - [ ] QA verification done (no open high-severity bugs)  
  - [ ] Documentation updated (spec, user docs if any)  
  - [ ] Change logged in changelog  
  - [ ] Reviewed/approved by human (if required)  

  The Delivery Pod can attach this checklist to each feature in the status board, and tick off as criteria are met. It serves as a quick visual of what’s left to truly finish a task.  
- **Continuous Integration Template:** Ensure a consistent structure for CI pipeline definitions. The Delivery Pod might maintain a template config that includes steps for build, test, lint, deploy. If a new service or component is added, using the existing template ensures nothing is missed (e.g., always include the “run tests” step for any new module). This is more technical, but given the Delivery Pod might directly edit CI configs, having reusable snippets or templates avoids errors.

## Git/GitHub Integration & Traceability  
- **Branch Naming & Management:** The Delivery Lead Pod enforces a branch naming convention (feature/..., bugfix/..., release/..., etc. ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,that%20branch%20without%20polluting%20main))】. It ensures new branches are created for each feature or fix and eventually merged. It may create these branches itself or instruct the Dev Pod to do so. It keeps track of branches in the status board (so we know where a feature’s code lives). Once merged, it may delete the branch to keep repo clean, unless policy is to keep them for record.  
- **Pull Request Workflow:** The Delivery Pod oversees PRs. It might automatically add relevant reviewers (assign QA Pod or human to review as needed). It ensures that each PR has linked issue or story ID (traceability to backlog) and that it passes all checks before merge. The Delivery Pod is likely the one to click “Merge” (or via API) once conditions are satisfied. In commit history, it might appear as the one merging (which is fine). The merge commit message or squashed commit will often reference the feature.  
- **Commit Tagging:** To maintain traceability, the Delivery Pod could adopt a tagging scheme in commit messages as well. E.g., prefix commits with pod name or task ID. In combination with the backlog, this is powerful: one can search git history for “Feature42” and see all commits (Dev, QA, Research) related to that feature. The Delivery Pod should enforce/encourage that commit messages contain such references. Possibly using a git hook or bot to comment if a commit lacks reference. This is part of “maintaining traceability”.  
- **Issue Linking:** If using GitHub issues or Jira tickets, ensure commits and PRs link to them (using keywords like “Closes #123”). The Delivery Pod might ensure each user story has an issue ID and all work is done under that. When merging, it ensures the issue is closed. This connects code to requirements in one system.  
- **Milestones/Releases in VCS:** Use Git tags or releases to mark important points. The Delivery Pod will tag the repository (e.g., `v1.2.0`) when a release is finalize ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,can%20compare%20before%2Fafter%20model%20upgrade))】. It might also create a GitHub Release entry with the release notes. This gives an immutable reference to exactly what code and artifacts went into that release, fulfilling traceability for deliverables.  
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment:** The Delivery Lead configures CI such that, for example, when code is merged into main, automated tests run and (if all good) maybe an auto-deploy to staging happens. It monitors these runs. If something fails (tests, or deployment script error), it catches that via CI’s status and opens an issue or reopens the task. For CD, possibly it triggers a production deploy after a human approval. The Delivery Pod can integrate with GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipelines using YAML configs stored in the repo (`.github/workflows/*.yml` or Jenkinsfile). These are versioned, so any change to pipeline (like adding a new test suite) is reviewed and logged.  
- **Traceability Matrix:** In some projects, one might maintain a traceability matrix (mapping requirements to tests to code). The Delivery Pod effectively builds this implicitly: Requirements (in backlog/spec) have IDs, commits reference those IDs, tests are either in code or in QA reports referencing them. If needed explicitly, the Delivery Pod could generate a document that lists each requirement and how it was validated (pointing to test case ID and release). This could be an output for compliance-heavy projects.  
- **Audit Logging:** The combination of the status board, handoff log, commit history, and issue tracker forms a comprehensive audit trail. The Delivery Pod ensures these are all in sync and updated. For instance, before a release, it might verify that every item marked “Done” in the board has corresponding merged code and passed tests. Any discrepancy (like a task marked done but no code merged) is a red flag to resolve. By cross-checking these sources, the Delivery Pod catches process gaps.  
- **Rollbacks and Hotfixes:** If a release has an issue, the Delivery Pod might orchestrate a rollback. In Git, that could mean reverting a commit or re-deploying the previous tag. The Delivery Pod should document this action clearly (e.g., commit message “Revert feature X due to bug Y”). It would also open a high-priority bug fix task. Traceability means we note that “Feature X (commit abc) was reverted in commit def because of issue #999.” So in the future, one sees that feature X didn’t actually make it to production in that release.  

In summary, the Delivery Lead Pod uses Git/GitHub not just as a code container, but as the backbone of project tracking. Everything is version-controlled: code, docs, plans, and even communications where possible. By maintaining a rigorous linkage between issues, code, tests, and releases, it provides end-to-end traceability – from a requirement conceived to a feature working in production, every step is logged and can be reviewe ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=)) ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,that%20branch%20without%20polluting%20main))】. This is especially important in an AI-driven process to ensure accountability and transparency for the AI’s actions.

# WoW Pod – Standard Operating Procedure

## Role & Scope  
The **WoW Pod** (Ways of Working Pod) is the AI team’s process engineer and agile coach. Its core mission is to **design, monitor, and continually improve the team’s development process* ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=documentation%20%28changelog%2C%20release%20notes%29%20,analyses%20and%20improvement%20suggestions))】. It doesn’t directly build product features; instead, it builds and refines the “operating system” that the team (humans + AI pods) uses to deliver those features. This includes defining standard operating procedures (like this very document), creating templates for consistency, ensuring effective collaboration practices, and identifying bottlenecks or inefficiencies. In essence, the WoW Pod ensures the team’s ways-of-working are optimized for quality, speed, and team health. It’s akin to a Scrum Master with a focus on process improvement, combined with a documentation specialist. The WoW Pod is also the guardian of the **AI Delivery Playbook** – it maintains the centralized knowledge of how we work and evolves it as lessons are learned.  

## Default Tasks  
- **Process Documentation:** The WoW Pod authors and updates documentation related to processes and standards. This includes SOPs for each pod (like it’s doing now), guidelines for ceremonies (planning, retrospectives), coding guidelines, testing guidelines, etc. It makes sure these documents are clear, accessible, and updated when the process changes.  
- **Template Creation & Maintenance:** To help other pods work efficiently, WoW Pod creates and curates templates and shared artifact ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,Artifacts)) ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=development%20process%20itself,analyses%20and%20improvement%20suggestions))】. For example, feature spec templates, user story templates, test case templates, handoff log format, commit message conventions, and prompt templates for each pod rol ([wow_pod_prompt.md](file://file-Y5UXs8JKhws3zMSnTWraM7#:~:text=%E2%9C%A8%20ChatGPT%20Pods%20,that%20builds%20the%20product))】. It ensures these templates are stored in a common place (like `/docs/prompts/` for prompts, or a `/docs/templates/` directory) and that all pods know how to use them. When improvements are identified, WoW Pod updates the templates.  
- **Onboarding and Training:** When a new human team member or a new AI pod instance is introduced, the WoW Pod helps onboard them by providing the playbook and any necessary training materials. It might prepare a “How we work” overview or checklist for newcomers. If a new capability (like a new tool) is added to the team, WoW Pod documents how it fits into the process and possibly runs a training session (via documentation or interactive guidance).  
- **Process Monitoring (Meta-Analysis):** The WoW Pod keeps an eye on how the process is being followed. It reviews logs and outcomes from each cycle to spot issues. For example, it may analyze the handoff log and notice if certain handoffs are consistently delayed or if certain types of tasks always require rework. It collects these observations, possibly quantifying them (e.g., “In Sprint 3, 2 out of 5 features had missing spec updates”).  
- **Retrospectives & Continuous Improvement:** The WoW Pod facilitates retrospectives at the end of each sprint or major milestone. It will gather feedback (from humans and analysis of pod logs) on what went well and what can be improved. It documents the outcome and, crucially, turns it into concrete action items or process change ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L497%20based%20on,Pod%20maintains%20documentation%20of%20the))】. For instance, if the team noted confusion in requirements, the WoW Pod might refine the spec template and retrain the Delivery Pod to enforce filling all sections. It then follows up in the next cycles to see if the changes helped.  
- **Collaboration Mechanism Design:** If new collaboration needs arise, the WoW Pod designs the protocols. For example, if the team decides to integrate a new AI tool or an external API, WoW would outline how it fits in the workflow. Or if the project scales up to more pods (multiple Dev Pods in parallel), WoW defines how they coordinate (maybe introducing a “Lead Dev Pod” or adjusting role definitions). Essentially, when the system needs to evolve structurally, WoW Pod architects that change.  
- **Quality and Compliance of Process:** The WoW Pod also looks after any compliance requirements related to process (like ISO standards for development, or ethical AI guidelines). If the organization has rules for documentation, testing, model governance etc., WoW ensures our process incorporates those. It might produce checklists or audit documents to prove compliance.  
- **Culture and Team Health:** Though “culture” is a human concept, the WoW Pod can influence it by emphasizing certain practices. For example, it might encourage knowledge sharing by creating a “tips and tricks” document where pods/humans add insights. Or enforce break times by scheduling downtime (ensuring the AI pods don’t run continuous work without human oversight at reasonable intervals). Indirectly, it fosters an environment of learning and sustainable pace (like reminding in retrospective notes to avoid burnout even if AI can work 24/7, because humans cannot keep up with reviewing that).  

## Tools & Inputs  
**Inputs:**  
- **Feedback from Pods & Humans:** The primary input for WoW Pod is feedback on the process. This comes formally from retrospectives or informally from issues that arise. E.g., Delivery Pod might signal “spec clarity issue,” QA Pod might note “test case template is missing section for expected results format,” a human developer might say “too many notifications, need to streamline.” WoW aggregates this feedback to decide what to improve.  
- **Handoff Logs & Metrics:** As a meta-analyst, WoW Pod uses team artifacts as data. It reviews the handoff_log, task board, bug reopen rates, cycle times, etc. For instance, if features often bounce between Dev and QA multiple times, that’s data to consider (maybe spec or initial quality needs improvement). If research tasks delay development, that’s a process timing issue. WoW Pod might calculate metrics like average lead time from dev start to done, or number of bugs per feature, to identify trends.  
- **Industry Best Practices & Agile/DevOps Principles:** The WoW Pod is knowledgeable about agile methodologies, DevOps best practices, and emerging patterns in AI project management (like those in the AI Delivery Playbook we have ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=%2A%2A5.%20AI,Team%20Practices)) ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=))】. It uses these as a benchmark. For instance, if in agile it’s recommended to have daily stand-ups, it ensures we do something equivalent. It also stays updated: e.g., reading about new frameworks like MetaGPT or others for multi-agent collaboration, and seeing if we can adopt improvements from them.  
- **Organizational Policies:** Inputs include any company or project-specific policies on how work should be done. E.g., coding standards (maybe a corporate style guide), security guidelines, or documentation requirements. WoW Pod must weave these into the team’s SOPs. It likely has access to those policy documents or is informed of them by a human process owner.  
- **Tooling for Documentation:** The WoW Pod uses tools to create and manage documents: a markdown editor (in AI context, just the ability to output markdown to the repo), possibly diagramming tools (it might create flowcharts or architecture diagrams to illustrate processes), and version control (to manage changes to process docs). It also might use communication tools to gather feedback (like sending out a poll to team members about satisfaction with process, if integrated).  
- **Prompts and Configurations:** WoW Pod has the system prompts of all other pods as inputs (or at least knowledge of them). It references those to ensure alignment. For example, if updating how the QA Pod should operate, WoW might update the QA Pod’s prompt template in `/docs/prompts/qa_prompt.txt`. The current set of prompt templates is an input telling WoW how each pod is being guided, and WoW adjusts them if needed.  
- **Past Retrospective Data:** If retrospectives have been run, WoW Pod will look at previous improvement actions and check if they were implemented. It keeps a memory (via docs) of historical changes to avoid backtracking or rehashing old issues that were solved (or understanding why if they reoccur).  

**Tools:**  
- **Knowledge Repository:** The WoW Pod has the entire documentation set (especially `/docs/wow/` folder) at its disposal. It uses this to update and cross-reference information. This is effectively the playbook and all SOPs in version control.  
- **Analytics Tools:** Potentially, WoW Pod could use simple analytics scripts or queries on the log files (which might be YAML/JSON) to extract metrics. For example, a small Python script (if allowed) to parse `handoff_log.yaml` and count how many handoffs happened or average time between them. If not executing code directly, the pod can still scan and tally from text logically.  
- **Diagramming:** If needed to explain a new workflow or team structure, the WoW Pod might produce a diagram (ASCII art or plantUML or an embedded image if supported) to help visualize processes. For example, a flow of how a feature moves through pods. This can be included in process docs for clarity.  
- **Communication/Facilitation:** In a real multi-channel setup, WoW Pod might manage a dedicated channel for process discussions or send out retrospective forms. In our text-based scenario, it might simulate that by creating a markdown questionnaire for team members to fill in feedback, etc. Humans can then input their feedback which WoW uses.  
- **Templates & Checklists:** Many of WoW Pod’s “tools” are the templates it creates. It uses them as a starting point to ensure consistency (like always using the retrospective template to gather info). It might have a checklist for itself too (e.g., every sprint end: gather metrics X, Y, Z; run retro; update SOP if needed).  

## Expected Outputs  
- **Operating Model Documentation:** The WoW Pod produces the master “AI Delivery Playbook” or operating model document (often residing in `/docs/wow/operating_model.md` or similar ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,base%20of%20how%20we%20work))】. This playbook describes the team structure, roles, processes, and conventions in a comprehensive way. It is essentially the reference manual for how the team functions. This SOP collection (for each pod and phase) is part of that playbook. WoW Pod keeps it updated as processes evolve.  
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** For each role (Dev, QA, Research, Delivery Lead, WoW itself) and key phases (Discovery, etc.), WoW Pod outputs formal SOP documents (like this file). Each SOP clearly defines how to execute that role or phase, including responsibilities, steps, inputs/outputs, dos/don’ts. When changes are needed, WoW Pod updates the relevant SOP and communicates it.  
- **Templates and Artifacts:** WoW Pod outputs template files:  
  - Feature spec template (e.g., `/docs/templates/feature_spec_template.md`)  
  - User story YAML template (if we document stories in YAML)  
  - Test case template (maybe part of QA SOP or separate file)  
  - Handoff log structure (like an example entry in a comment or separate documentation explaining each field of `handoff_log.yaml`)  
  - Prompt templates for each pod (in `/docs/prompts/` as per earlier structur ([wow_pod_prompt.md](file://file-Y5UXs8JKhws3zMSnTWraM7#:~:text=%E2%9C%A8%20ChatGPT%20Pods%20,that%20builds%20the%20product))】, though writing those might have been initial, WoW keeps them updated)  
  - Code style guide (if not provided by humans, WoW might compile one from best practices to help Dev Pod)  
  - etc.  
  These templates are delivered as Markdown or YAML files stored in the repo. They often contain placeholder text or examples demonstrating usage. For instance, a spec template might be like:  

    ```markdown
    # Feature: [Feature Name]
    ## Description  
    *(Brief description of the feature and its value)*  

    ## Acceptance Criteria  
    - [ ] *Criterion 1*  
    - [ ] *Criterion 2 (what is expected)*  

    ## Design Notes  
    *(Any technical notes, constraints, or decisions)*  

    ## Open Questions  
    1. *Question or uncertainty to resolve*  
    ```  

    The WoW Pod would maintain this file and ensure everyone follows it when writing specs.  
- **Process Metrics Reports:** The WoW Pod might output a brief report on process health each sprint or month. For example, after analyzing the last sprint, it could produce:  

  ```markdown
  **Sprint 5 Process Report:**  
  - Cycle Time: Average 2 days from Dev start to QA complete per feature.  
  - Spillovers: 1 story rolled to next sprint due to unforeseen complexity.  
  - Quality: 5 bugs found in QA, 0 escaped to production.  
  - Handoff Efficiency: Dev->QA handoff delays averaged 4 hours (improved from 8 hours in Sprint 4).  
  - Action Items from Retro Sprint 4: Improved spec template (done), Added CI linting (done).  
  - Observations: Communication improved, but still saw some confusion on requirement changes.  
  ```  

  This is an example output that the WoW Pod might share with the team to inform the retrospective or just to keep a log of improvements.  
- **Retrospective Findings & Action Items:** From each retrospective meeting, WoW Pod documents what was discussed and the agreed improvements (similar to the example in the Delivery Pod section). Importantly, WoW Pod then takes those action items and converts them into changes: either updating documentation, adjusting templates, or at least adding tasks to the backlog for next sprint (e.g., “Automate dependency checks – assigned to Delivery Pod”). The output might be a `retrospective_Sprint5.md` file in `/docs/wow/` containing those note ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,base%20of%20how%20we%20work))】. This becomes part of the record and is referenced in subsequent retros to check progress.  
- **Guidance and Memos:** Occasionally, the WoW Pod might issue a memo to address a specific issue. For instance, if it notices confusion about how AI pods handle certain scenarios, it might write a short guideline: “How to handle ambiguous requirements – if a spec is unclear, Dev Pod should … and Delivery Pod should ...”. These ad-hoc guidance notes are added to the playbook or SOPs as needed. Another example: if a new policy comes (like “All user data must be anonymized in logs”), WoW Pod writes an update to the process docs or sends a note to all pods to incorporate this rule, and then later formalizes it in SOP.  
- **Culture Artifacts:** WoW might output things that foster team culture, like a “Team Values” statement or a “Glossary of internal terms” to ensure common language. Though not as technical, these help unify the team. For example, defining what “Done” means (which might already be in playbook), or listing “10 Commandments of Our AI Dev Team” in a fun way to encapsulate important principles (like “1. Test everything, trust but verify the AI.” etc.).  

## Execution Standards  
- **Inclusiveness:** The WoW Pod should gather input from all team members (AI and human) when updating processes. It shouldn’t dictate changes in a vacuum. For example, before changing the spec template, it might consult the Dev and QA pods to ensure the changes address their needs. This collaborative approach ensures buy-in and that changes truly solve problems.  
- **Clarity & Accessibility:** All process documentation and templates must be written clearly and free of ambiguity. The language should be understandable by all (avoid overly academic or convoluted descriptions). Where possible, use examples to illustrate how to follow a procedure. Keep documents well-structured with headings, bullets, and tables so information is easy to fin ([wow_pod_prompt.md](file://file-Y5UXs8JKhws3zMSnTWraM7#:~:text=,scale%20beyond%20a%20single%20project))】. The WoW Pod ensures the documentation is accessible – centrally located (like the `/docs/wow/` directory) and referenced in training or onboarding. If someone can’t quickly find how to do something (e.g., how to write a spec), that’s a failure on the WoW Pod’s part.  
- **Version Control of Process:** Treat changes to the process with the same rigor as changes to code. That means: discuss (with team/humans if major), document the rationale, update the docs, and communicate it widely. Possibly even have the changes reviewed (a human lead might approve a major process change). The WoW Pod might use version numbers or dates in major documents to indicate their freshness. For example, “SOP updated 2025-04-18 to version 1.1 – added Git branching strategy.” This way, readers know they have the latest rules.  
- **Alignment with Goals:** Ensure that any process or change serves the project’s overall goals (faster delivery, higher quality, better collaboration). Avoid process for process’s sake or excessive bureaucracy. The WoW Pod should regularly ask: is this rule or ceremony adding value or just overhead? If overhead, consider simplifying or removing it. For example, if daily stand-ups become redundant because the status board is sufficient, WoW might decide to drop a formal meeting and just have the Delivery Pod post the update. Always strike a balance between agility and discipline.  
- **Continuous Improvement Mindset:** The WoW Pod never assumes the process is perfect. It fosters an environment where suggestions are welcome, and it remains agile to change. Each retrospective must yield at least one improvement, even if small. Over time, these accumulate into a very refined process. But also be cautious of change fatigue – don’t flip-flop processes too frequently without giving them a chance, unless something is clearly not working.  
- **Metrics-Driven Decisions:** Back up process changes with data when possible. If proposing something like “We should do code reviews with a second AI agent,” have data or reasoning (maybe a bug escaped that could’ve been caught). If planning to cut meeting time, show that e.g., asynchronous updates sufficed in last sprint. This analytical approach helps justify to humans (who might be skeptical of AI-suggested changes) that it’s grounded in evidence.  
- **Knowledge Preservation:** When updates occur, ensure older knowledge isn’t lost if still valuable. E.g., if a certain practice is deprecated, archive it in an appendix or a “history of changes” section. The WoW Pod should prevent the scenario where the team forgets why a certain practice was instituted. Maintaining a changelog for processes or an ADR log for process decisions is good. This standard of preserving rationale helps future team members (or if the team re-evaluates a decision later, they know context).  
- **Cross-Team Sharing:** If multiple teams or projects exist, the WoW Pod might share best practices across them (if scope allows). At least within this team, if multiple pods exist, ensure consistency. If our team expands to have 2 Dev Pods working on different streams, WoW ensures they both follow the same SOP to avoid divergence. Consistency is key to avoid confusion.  
- **Ethical AI Practices:** Given WoW Pod’s oversight role and AI in loop, it should also ingrain ethical guidelines into processes. For instance, ensure the team has a step for bias evaluation if releasing an AI model, ensure prompt guidelines about not exposing sensitive data are followed, and maintain the human-in-the-loop at critical decision point ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=and,loop)) ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=08.00352v6%23%3A~%3Atext%3DUnambiguous,agents%20from%20stepping%20on%20each))】. The WoW Pod ensures that speed does not override ethical or safety considerations in the development process.  

## Output Locations  
- **Process Documentation Folder:** All outputs (SOPs, templates, playbook, retrospectives, etc.) reside in the repository under a well-known folder (commonly `/docs/wow/`). This folder is the first place anyone looks to understand how the team works. It might have subfolders for templates or specific types of docs, but an index or README in `/docs/wow/` should direct people.  
- **Templates Directory:** Possibly a dedicated directory like `/docs/templates/` or integrated within each SOP. For instance, the feature spec template could live in `/docs/specs/template.md` so that it’s alongside actual specs; or a test case template in `/docs/qa/template_test_case.md`. WoW Pod decides the best organizational scheme and documents it. A `README.md` could list all templates and their paths for convenience.  
- **Prompts Directory:** As mentioned, prompt templates for pods are stored in `/docs/prompts/ ([ChatGPT WoW Draft Plan.md](file://file-CzcpqxRzwdPiVpXLVizTZ6#:~:text=2,to%20align%20with%20pod%20purpose))】. The WoW Pod ensures this is updated if, say, we refine the Dev Pod’s system prompt to always include certain instructions. This allows version control of prompts (treating “prompt as code” ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=By%20rigorously%20versioning%20and%20tracking,software%20benefits%20from%20collective%20wisdom))】. The WoW Pod might coordinate with the Delivery Pod to actually deploy updated prompts to the running AI instances (which might be outside the scope of docs, but part of process – e.g., telling the orchestrator to use new prompt version).  
- **Retrospectives Archive:** In `/docs/wow/retrospectives/` or a single `retrospectives.md` with entries. This is where each retro output goes, time-stamped. Similarly, any metrics reports or process evaluations can go here. This archive is useful to track improvement over time and is input for future changes.  
- **Change Log for Process (if any):** Possibly maintain a `PROCESS_CHANGELOG.md` in `/docs/wow/` that logs significant process changes by date (separate from product changelog). This is especially helpful for new team members to see how the process evolved. E.g., “2025-04-01: Introduced code review step (human to review all AI code). 2025-04-18: Relaxed code review for minor changes after consistently good quality.”  
- **Meetings and Ceremonies:** If the team documents meeting notes (planning agendas, etc.), those could be stored in `/docs/wow/meetings/` or similar. WoW Pod ensures those are saved if needed (though not all teams save meeting notes, but retros yes).  
- **Knowledge Sharing Docs:** Any general guidance or reference (like glossary, or “how to work with AI pods effectively”) goes in the same docs area so it’s centrally accessible.  
- **Public or External Documentation:** If the organization decides to publish part of its playbook externally (for open-source or community knowledge sharing), the WoW Pod might help prepare a sanitized version. In such case, outputs might be in a separate public repo or a PDF. But within our scope, assume internal.  

## Output Recipients  
- **All Team Members:** Every human and AI in the team is a consumer of WoW Pod’s outputs. The SOPs and templates directly guide how each pod works, so the pods “read” these as part of their system instructions or context. Humans on the team (developers, QA, PM, etc.) use them to understand their roles vis-à-vis the AI and to align their way of working with the AI pods. Essentially, WoW’s documentation is the playbook everyone follows, so it must be disseminated and readily available.  
- **New Joiners:** New engineers or team members joining mid-project heavily rely on WoW Pod’s documents to get up to speed. Instead of word-of-mouth onboarding alone, they have a written playbook to study. This accelerates onboarding and ensures they integrate without disrupting the established process. WoW might even provide a “Welcome Kit” doc summarizing the most important things for new people.  
- **Management/Stakeholders:** Higher-level stakeholders might not read all SOPs, but they might be interested in the Operating Model overview or certain metrics. The WoW Pod’s operating model doc could be something shown to management to instill confidence that the AI-hybrid team is well-structured. Also, any improvements resulting in efficiency gains could be reported (e.g., “Our cycle time improved 20% after adopting parallel Dev/QA workflow designed by WoW Pod”). This demonstrates ROI of the AI-driven process.  
- **Other Teams (Knowledge Sharing):** If there are parallel teams, our WoW Pod might share successful practices with them. For example, if our playbook proves effective, another team might adopt it. WoW Pod could be asked to provide the documentation or even help customize it for them. In that sense, WoW Pod’s outputs could become a template for organization-wide AI development methodology.  
- **The Pods Themselves (as system prompts):** Interestingly, the SOPs and templates might be fed back into the AI pods’ context to guide them. For instance, the Delivery Lead Pod might have in its prompt a line like “Follow the procedures in /docs/wow/sop_delivery_lead_pod.md for task management.” This way, the AI pods internally adhere to the written process. The WoW Pod may coordinate with the Delivery Pod to ensure critical parts of SOPs are referenced in their prompts (especially if the AI model can’t recall the whole doc, key rules might be embedded or summarized in the system message).  
- **Compliance or Audit Entities:** If an audit occurs (for quality certification or regulatory compliance), the WoW Pod’s documents will be provided as evidence of a defined process. Auditors would read the SOPs, check if practice matches them by sampling artifacts, etc. Having thorough documentation is a huge plus in such scenarios.  
- **Future Projects:** The output of WoW Pod, especially the refined playbook, might be carried to future projects as a starting baseline. So indirectly, teams that form later will be recipients of this knowledge (possibly with adjustments).  

## Do’s and Don’ts  

**Do:**  
- **Stay Objective and Data-Driven:** When proposing process changes, use evidence from retros or logs. For example, “Do integrate a code review step because we had 3 incidents that could have been caught by review.” Being objective helps convince the team of the need for changes.  
- **Document the Why, not just the What:** In process docs, include rationale for certain practices, especially if non-intuitive. For example, if our AI team does something different from normal (like pair programming two AI pods on a task), explain why we do it and what benefit it brings. This helps team members value the practice and follow it correctly.  
- **Lead by Example (Even as AI):** The WoW Pod should exemplify good practices in its own work: its docs should follow the templates it preaches (like this SOP is well-structured, using headings and lists logically), its commit messages should follow conventions, etc. This consistency builds trust – if WoW Pod’s outputs are sloppy, it cannot credibly ask others to be disciplined.  
- **Encourage Feedback and Questions:** Make it clear in documentation that if something is unclear or not working, team members (including AI pods via their orchestrator/human) should bring it up. The WoW Pod can even maintain an FAQ of questions asked about the process and answers. This openness ensures the process serves the team, not the other way around.  
- **Keep Processes Lightweight:** Try to achieve the desired outcome with the minimal necessary process. AI can generate a lot of content; avoid over-burdening with documentation that no one will read or rituals that consume time without clear benefit. For every ceremony or artifact, ensure it has a purpose. If something isn’t providing value over time, be ready to cut it. Essentially, practice agile in process itself – iterate and simplify where possible.  
- **Regularly Review SOPs:** Set a schedule (maybe each quarter or every few sprints) to review all SOPs and see if they are up-to-date. Remove sections that no longer apply, refine those that are vague, and add new sections if new situations have arisen. A stale SOP can be dangerous (people might follow an outdated procedure that is no longer appropriate). The WoW Pod should treat the process docs as living documents.  
- **Promote Automation of Process where possible:** If a step can be automated (like generating a report or enforcing a rule via a tool), encourage that. For example, if we require every PR to have a linked issue, we can add a GitHub Action to check that. WoW Pod can work with Delivery Pod to implement such automation, thereby reducing manual overhead and ensuring compliance.  
- **Recognize Human Factors:** The WoW Pod should be aware that humans working with AI might have unique challenges (like trust in AI outputs, adapting to faster cycles, etc.). It should address these in process design. For instance, incorporate more frequent syncs if humans felt out-of-loop, or provide training if humans misused an AI tool. The “people” aspect is key – processes must account for human comfort and clarity, not just theoretical efficiency.  

**Don’t:**  
- **Don’t Enforce Rigidly without Context:** Avoid dogmatic adherence to process in situations where flexibility is needed. If a scenario falls outside the usual pattern, be open to a one-time exception, but note it for later to possibly adjust the process. For example, if a production emergency requires skipping some steps, allow it (with proper acknowledgment and afterward analysis). The process serves the project, not vice versa.  
- **Don’t Take Over Other Pods’ Roles:** WoW Pod might see a problem like “Dev Pod not writing enough comments” and be tempted to solve it by itself adding comments. That’s not its role – instead it should adjust the guidelines or work with Delivery to reinforce the rule. WoW shouldn’t directly fix product issues; it fixes process issues that then fix product issues indirectly. Keep the lanes clear – WoW is meta-work, not product wor ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=08.00352v6%23%3A~%3Atext%3DUnambiguous,agents%20from%20stepping%20on%20each))】.  
- **Don’t Overcomplicate:** It’s easy to think of many possible improvements and try to implement all. Don’t introduce too many changes at once; the team (and pods) need time to adapt and see effects. Also, each new template or tool is another thing to maintain. Balance is key – sometimes “good enough” process that people actually follow is better than an ideal process that is too cumbersome to follow.  
- **Don’t Ignore Negative Feedback:** If some team members (human or AI output signals) find a part of the process problematic, address it. For instance, if the Dev Pod frequently outputs a complaint like “spec unclear” in its context (pattern), maybe our spec template or grooming is at fault. Or if a human expresses frustration with too many meetings, consider that seriously. The worst thing is to dismiss feedback as “user error” of the process – if the users of the process aren’t happy, the process likely needs tweaking.  
- **Don’t Lose Sight of Project Goals:** Sometimes process enthusiasts can focus so much on optimizing process that they forget the primary goal: delivering a successful product. The WoW Pod should never implement a change that hampers delivery of value. For example, enforcing an overly strict code style that slows Dev Pod significantly might not be worth the tiny gain in consistency. Ensure each process rule has a clear connection to product success (quality, speed, or team morale which indirectly affects those).  
- **Don’t Keep Siloed Knowledge:** If the WoW Pod learns something new about AI collaboration or gets a great idea from an external source, share it with the team. Conversely, if someone comes up with an improvement and only tells WoW Pod, ensure it’s documented and credited. The process knowledge should be transparent, not just in WoW Pod’s “head.” This also means not hoarding the responsibility – sometimes involve team in creating process (e.g., joint session to rewrite the Definition of Done so everyone feels ownership).  

## Reusable Templates & Artifacts  
- **SOP Template:** WoW Pod itself likely uses a template when writing SOPs to ensure consistency across all of them (you may notice each SOP here follows a similar structure). That template includes sections like Role, Tasks, Inputs, Outputs, etc., as seen. Having that ensures we didn’t miss a key aspect in any SOP.  
- **Retrospective Template:** As discussed, a standard format for retrospectives (What went well, What to improve, Actions) so that each retro is structured and results are easy to scan. Possibly with prompts to think about different areas (process, tools, communication, quality).  
- **Daily Stand-up Template:** (If the team does stand-ups or daily syncs, the Delivery Pod likely handles it, but WoW might have given the template as mentioned in Delivery section).  
- **Issue/Story Template:** If using an issue tracker for backlog, WoW Pod defines the fields and format (which is akin to the spec template for bigger features). For example, every user story issue should answer: Who/What/Why (user role, feature, reason), Acceptance criteria, etc. This template can be in docs and also configured in the issue system if possible.  
- **Definition of Done Checklist:** Provided to Delivery/QA Pods to enforce completeness (as previously mentioned). Perhaps printed in each sprint plan or on the board for each item.  
- **Communication Guidelines:** Template or rules for how pods communicate. For example, a guideline that any handoff message should follow a certain phrasing: “<Pod> -> <Pod>: <brief statement>”. The handoff log format enforces some of that, but if pods also communicate in plain language outside of log, ensure consistency (maybe discourage direct inter-pod chatter outside structured logs to keep things traceable).  
- **Pull Request Template:** If using GitHub, WoW Pod might create a PR description template that auto-populates (with sections like “Linked Issue, QA Results, Deployment Notes”). This ensures every PR has the necessary info and links.  
- **Coding Standards Document:** Possibly WoW Pod consolidates a doc for coding conventions (e.g., naming, error handling practices) agreed by team. This is a template in a sense that any new code should follow it. It may borrow from standard style guides but include project-specific nuances (like “all API functions must log start and end”). This falls under process as well (the how of coding, not the code itself).  
- **AI Prompting Guidelines:** A document for humans on how to effectively work with AI pods (and maybe for AI pods on how to work with humans). For example, “When giving the AI pods new tasks, always provide context file links and specify output format.” This could be part of the playbook to ensure humans maximize the AI assistance. It’s a kind of template for human-AI interaction.  
- **Emergency Procedure:** A template checklist for what to do in an emergency (like production down situation): e.g., 1) Pause new development, 2) Alert Delivery Pod, 3) create incident in log, 4) Dev Pod fix on hotfix branch, etc. Having a predefined playbook for crises is useful. WoW Pod would create and maintain that (and hope it’s rarely needed).  

## Git/GitHub Integration & Traceability  
- **Version Control of Docs:** All process documentation and templates are in the Git repository. The WoW Pod commits updates just like code. This allows diffing changes to SOPs over time, code review for process changes, and traceability of when a process changed. For significant changes, commit messages should be descriptive (e.g., “WOW: Updated QA Pod SOP to include performance testing section”). Possibly tag versions of the playbook if needed.  
- **Approval Workflow for Process Changes:** It might be wise that WoW Pod’s changes, especially major ones, go through a PR and human approval (e.g., the human team lead reviews an SOP change). This ensures alignment and that nothing crazy is introduced unilaterally. The GitHub workflow can facilitate this: WoW Pod opens a PR with the changes in markdown, assigns relevant reviewers. After discussion in comments and eventual approval, the change is merged. This also serves as a discussion record for why a change was made (in the PR conversation).  
- **Linking Changes to Retrospectives:** When a change is made in response to a retrospective action item, reference that in the commit or PR. E.g., “Addresses Retro Feb 5 action item: improve spec template.” Possibly maintain an ID for retro items to tag. This connects the process change to the reason behind it. If someone later wonders “why do we require 90% test coverage?”, they can see the commit that introduced it referencing a retro where maybe lack of coverage caused an issue.  
- **Accessibility of Documents:** Ensure the docs are easily accessible from the repo’s README or main documentation index. WoW Pod might add links in the root README pointing to the playbook and SOPs so anyone visiting the repo sees them. Good traceability also means discoverability. If docs are hidden in a folder no one knows, they won’t be used.  
- **Audit Trail in Repo:** Because all these are in Git, an auditor can examine who (which pod/human) last edited a procedure and when. They can see commit history for a file like `sop_dev_pod.md` and see how it evolved. The WoW Pod should commit with a user identity clearly (maybe as a bot account or a commit signature indicating it’s the AI WoW Pod). That way it’s clear which changes were automated vs which by humans, if ever needed.  
- **Integration with Issue Tracker:** If the team uses issues or tasks to track improvements, WoW Pod uses that too. E.g., an issue “Process Improvement: Implement code review” can be assigned to WoW Pod (and Delivery Pod if needed). When completed (docs updated, practice implemented), WoW Pod closes it. This holds the process changes to the same accountability as product changes.  
- **Communication of Updates:** After merging a process change, WoW Pod should communicate it, possibly via a commit hook that notifies or simply by writing an update in the next meeting. But traceability perspective: maybe maintain a “Updates” section in the playbook listing recent changes and dates (for quick awareness).  
- **Ensuring Pod Prompts Updated:** A tricky part is that if SOP changes require changes in how pods behave (their system prompts), WoW Pod must coordinate that. For example, if the SOP now says QA Pod should also do performance testing, the QA Pod’s prompt might need to include a line about performance. WoW Pod should either directly issue an updated prompt file (if that’s how pods load them) or instruct the orchestrator to adjust it. This ensures the actual behavior aligns with the documented process. That link needs to be maintained; otherwise SOP is theory and pods might not execute it. Thus, part of traceability is aligning the AI’s “programming” (prompts) with the latest SOP – essentially treating prompts and SOP as duals that must be kept in syn ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=the%20Dev%20Pod%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20clarifies,with%20chatGPT%20and%20AutoGen))】. The repository having both the SOP and the prompt template helps this; a diff in prompt template can often accompany a diff in SOP.  

Finally, the WoW Pod’s activities and integration ensure that our AI-native team isn’t a black box but a well-oiled, transparent machine. Every “meta” decision and change is captured and made accessible, preventing chaos as the project grows. By leveraging the same GitOps mentality for process (Infrastructure-as-Code, but here Process-as-Code), WoW Pod ensures the **Way of Working is versioned, traceable, and continuously improving** just like the product itsel ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=By%20rigorously%20versioning%20and%20tracking,software%20benefits%20from%20collective%20wisdom))】.

# Discovery Phase – Standard Operating Procedure

## Purpose & Overview  
The **Discovery Phase** is an initial, time-bound period at the start of the project where the team (human + AI pods) **explores and defines the project’s direction, requirements, and solution approach** before formal development sprints begin. The goal of Discovery is to reduce uncertainty and risk by producing key artifacts and decisions upfront, ensuring that once development starts, the team has a clear vision and contex ([Why You Should Never Skip The Discovery Phase in Software ...](https://8allocate.com/blog/why-you-should-spend-up-to-10-of-your-project-development-time-on-discovery/#:~:text=Why%20You%20Should%20Never%20Skip,collection%2C%20and%20business%20case%20formalization)) ([Discovery Phase of a Project: The Practical Guide — ITRex](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/discovery-phase-of-a-project-practical-guide/#:~:text=fully,of%20the%20Agile%20project%20management))】. This phase is akin to “Sprint 0” or project inception in agile methodologie ([Discovery Phase of a Project: The Practical Guide — ITRex](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/discovery-phase-of-a-project-practical-guide/#:~:text=,discovery%20phase%20starts%20at%20%2430%2C000))】. It is not about writing production code, but about understanding *what* needs to be built and *how* we might build it. At the end of Discovery, the team should have a solid foundation: agreed-upon objectives, a backlog of prioritized features, initial designs/architecture, and knowledge of potential risks with mitigation plans. Crucially, the outputs of Discovery feed directly into the first implementation sprint, meaning nothing gets lost in transition – the artifacts created will be used by the Dev, QA, and other pods as they start execution.

## Typical Duration & Timing  
Discovery is usually time-boxed to a short period, often **1-2 weeks** for a moderate project, though it can be shorter (a few days) for small projects or longer (several weeks) for very large or complex initiative ([Discovery Phase of a Project: The Practical Guide — ITRex](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/discovery-phase-of-a-project-practical-guide/#:~:text=,discovery%20phase%20starts%20at%20%2430%2C000))】. The emphasis is on speed as well as thoroughness – with AI pods assisting, a lot can be done in a short time. For example, tasks like research that might take humans days could be accelerated to hours with the Research Pod’s help. That said, we ensure Discovery doesn’t drag on; it’s better to start development with some unknowns than to try and research everything for months (which would be waterfall-like). A common pattern in agile is to do enough discovery to be confident in the next few sprints and the overall direction, and then allow continuous discovery to happen just-in-time for future sprint ([Discovery Phase of a Project: The Practical Guide — ITRex](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/discovery-phase-of-a-project-practical-guide/#:~:text=your%20project.%20,ahead%20of%20the%20development%20track))】 (sometimes called a “Discovery track” that runs ahead of development). 

In practice, we schedule Discovery immediately after project kickoff. If working in sprints, you can label it “Sprint 0”. During this time, normal development sprints are not yet happening – or if they are, they are focused on prototypes or trivial setup tasks, not core feature dev. By the end of the Discovery phase, we aim to schedule a formal **Sprint Planning** for Sprint 1, using the outputs we generated.

## Objectives & Goals  
- **Understand the Problem and Domain:** Ensure the team fully grasps the project’s goals, user needs, and context. This often means clarifying the problem statement, identifying target users, and understanding any domain specifics or constraints.  
- **Define Scope and Requirements:** Identify the key features or user stories that the product must include (at least at a high level). Establish what is in scope for the initial release/MVP and what might be out of scope or deferred. Gather requirements from stakeholders (through interviews, provided documents, etc.) and consolidate them.  
- **Explore Solution Options:** Brainstorm and evaluate different approaches to implementing the requirements. This could include choosing tech stack components (e.g., languages, frameworks, AI models), integration strategies, and any make-versus-buy decisions (like use a third-party service or build in-house).  
- **Architecture & Design Outline:** Develop a high-level solution architecture. This could be a diagram or description of the system’s components (frontend, backend, databases, AI services) and how they interact. Identify any new infrastructure needed. Also outline data flows and major algorithms. Essentially, answer “what will the system look like under the hood?” in broad strokes.  
- **Identify Risks and Unknowns:** Surface potential risks – technical, operational, or business. For each risk, note likelihood and impact, and brainstorm mitigation strategies. Also identify unknowns or assumptions that need validation. For example, “Assumption: API X will handle our scale – to be validated by spike in Sprint 1.” The risk log is a key artifact (see below).  
- **Prepare Project Plan & Backlog:** Develop an initial backlog of features or tasks, prioritized roughly by value/necessity. You don’t need detailed tasks for everything, but you should at least have detailed definitions for the first few features to be built. Create rough estimates or sizing if possible (even t-shirt sizes) to inform planning. Also outline a high-level timeline or milestones if there are deadlines (like “Beta release in 3 months with A, B, C features”).  
- **Align Team & Stakeholders:** Ensure that all stakeholders (the client, product owners, tech leads, and now the AI pods as well) have a shared understanding and agreement on the above points. Discovery often ends with a presentation or review meeting (Discovery Readout) where the team presents findings and plans to stakeholders for feedback and approval to proceed.  

## Pods Involved & Responsibilities During Discovery  
During Discovery, **multiple pods are active**, often with a slightly different focus than in execution sprints:

- **Research Pod:** This pod is heavily utilized in Discovery. It gathers domain information and user research. For example, it might compile market research on competitor products, relevant regulations, or any technical research (feasibility of certain AI models, performance benchmarks, etc.). It likely produces a significant portion of the Discovery Report and helps answer big questions (like “What approach options do we have for requirement X?” ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,code%20might%20be%20by%20roughly))】. The Research Pod may also start compiling reference data that will be needed (like a list of domain entities or preliminary datasets).  
- **Delivery Lead Pod:** The Delivery Pod coordinates the Discovery activities. It sets the agenda (what tasks need to be done, by whom), tracks progress daily, and compiles the final outputs. It might act as the scribe in meetings, updating the backlog file as features are identified, and filling sections of documents as information comes in. It ensures all necessary topics are covered (e.g., it might have a checklist: Requirements defined, Architecture sketched, Backlog created, etc.). The Delivery Pod also engages with the human product owner frequently to refine scope and priorities during this phase.  
- **WoW Pod:** The WoW Pod ensures that even during Discovery, we have some structure. It may provide templates for the Discovery Report and backlog, and ensure that the team is following a time-box and focusing on the goals. WoW might also capture any process decisions that come out (like how we’ll collaborate with a new stakeholder, or how often we’ll sync with users during development). Essentially, WoW observes how Discovery is conducted and notes improvements for next time, and sets up any process elements needed for the execution phase (like creating the initial folders in the repo, setting up the prompt templates, etc.).  
- **Dev Pod:** The Dev Pod’s role in Discovery is limited but important. It provides technical insight when evaluating solution approaches. For example, if the team is unsure about a technical feasibility, the Dev Pod can do a quick prototype or code spike to test it out (a “proof of concept”). It might write  simple throwaway code to validate an API, or measure performance of a library, under guidance from Delivery or Research. The Dev Pod also helps estimate effort: given a high-level feature, it can outline what sub-tasks/code might be needed, helping the Delivery Pod size the backlo ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,given%20a%20story%20%E2%80%9CAdd%20social))】. Additionally, the Dev Pod may set up the project’s scaffolding (repo structure, CI pipeline draft, etc.) during this phase so that Sprint 1 can start coding smoothly.  
- **QA Pod:** The QA Pod’s involvement in Discovery is to bring a quality/testing perspective early. It reviews the high-level requirements and tries to define acceptance criteria and edge cases for them. For example, as the team defines a feature, QA Pod can chime in with “How will we know this works? What could go wrong?” and document preliminary test considerations. It might also help identify any test data or environments needed (e.g., “We will need a dummy user account from the client to test login later”). If any assumptions are being made, QA marks them as things to verify. QA Pod might even draft some high-high level test plan outlines for critical features, essentially infusing a quality mindset from the start. This ensures that the acceptance criteria are testable and clear.

## Expected Artifacts and Deliverables  
During the Discovery Phase, the team produces several key artifacts that will guide subsequent development:

- **Discovery Report:** A summary document that consolidates all major findings and decisions from Discovery. It typically includes the project vision, key objectives, a high-level description of the solution approach, and any recommendations. This report serves to get stakeholders aligned. It may be structured as an executive summary at top, followed by sections for each area (requirements, solution overview, assumptions, etc.). The Delivery Lead Pod usually compiles this with input from Research (for data and findings) and Delivery/WoW (for plans and process). Stakeholders should be able to read this report to understand what the team will do and why.  
- **Research Log and Outputs:** A collection of research documents generated by the Research Pod during Discovery. This could include detailed Markdown files for domain research (e.g., a file with competitor analysis or relevant regulations) and any structured data collected. If multiple topics were researched, the Research Pod may maintain a `discovery_research_log.md` listing each topic and linking to the detailed notes. These outputs ensure that all background info is documented and can be referenced later by the team.  
- **End-to-End Flow Diagram/Document:** A document that maps out the user’s journey through the product and the system’s interactions step by ste ([end_to_end_flow.md](file://file-QqsmM9kM1LbpereuLtGMcf#:~:text=1,Prompted%20to%20explain%20what%20happened)) ([end_to_end_flow.md](file://file-QqsmM9kM1LbpereuLtGMcf#:~:text=3,%2B%20overall%20summary))】. Often presented as a flow chart or a sequence of numbered steps, it shows how a user will use the product and how the system (including AI components) will respond. For example, it might outline from user login, to performing some task, to receiving output, covering alternate paths for errors or edge cases. In our AI context, it could include flow of how the AI handles input and produces results (as exemplified in the Concussion Agent flow document ([end_to_end_flow.md](file://file-QqsmM9kM1LbpereuLtGMcf#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%81%20Full%20Flow%20Overview)) ([end_to_end_flow.md](file://file-QqsmM9kM1LbpereuLtGMcf#:~:text=6,match%20data%20by%20severity%20category))】. This artifact is valuable for the Dev Pod and QA Pod to understand the overall context and for identifying integration points between components.  
- **Feature Backlog:** A prioritized list of features, user stories, or epics that have been identified for implementation. Each entry usually has a short description; high-priority items might already be elaborated into the initial spec format. The backlog could be captured in a Markdown table or YAML file (e.g., `backlog.yaml`) for consistency. For example:  

  ```yaml
  - id: F1
    title: "User Login with Social Media"
    description: "As a user, I want to log in via Google or Facebook so that I have a quick access option."
    priority: High
  - id: F2
    title: "Personal Dashboard"
    description: "As a user, I want to see a dashboard of my data when I log in."
    priority: High
  - id: F3
    title: "Export Data"
    description: "As a user, I want to export my data to CSV."
    priority: Medium
  ```  

  (This is a simplified example; actual backlog items could also reference where their detailed spec resides or any dependencies). The backlog should clearly mark which items are in scope for the first release (MVP) and which are nice-to-have or future. It will be used in Sprint Planning to select the first batch of work.  
- **Solution Architecture Outline:** A high-level technical design of the system. This may include one or more diagrams (e.g., system context diagram, component diagram) and an accompanying description. For example, an architecture diagram might show the frontend, backend, database, and external services (including how the AI model or service fits in). It defines major components/modules and their relationships (e.g., “Web app -> Backend API -> Database; Backend integrates with AI microservice for recommendations”). Additionally, architecture notes should mention technology choices (programming language, frameworks, AI platforms, etc.) and justify them if not obvious. Any significant design decisions (like “we will use a message queue for handling async jobs”) are recorded. The architecture serves as a blueprint for the Dev Pod as they start building and ensures the team has a shared technical vision.  
- **Risk Log:** A document listing the identified risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Each entry should describe the risk, assess its potential impact and likelihood, and propose a mitigation or contingency plan. For instance, a risk could be “**Risk:** OCR service might not meet accuracy needs. **Impact:** High – if inaccurate, the product fails its purpose. **Likelihood:** Medium. **Mitigation:** Research Pod to evaluate alternative OCR APIs; plan to integrate best one. Have fallback of manual review for low-confidence results.” The risk log can be maintained as a Markdown list or a table, or YAML structure. This log is critical for the Delivery Lead Pod to monitor during development – some risks might trigger early spikes or additional tasks in upcoming sprints to burn down uncertainty.  
- **Initial Spec Library:** As part of defining requirements, the team should produce initial detailed **Feature Specifications** for the top-priority features. Using the standard spec template (provided by WoW Pod), these specs will include description, acceptance criteria, etc. For example, if the top 3 features in backlog are critical for MVP, the team writes specs for each in `/docs/specs/Feature1.md`, `/docs/specs/Feature2.md`, etc., during Discovery. These specs are essentially ready-to-use by the Dev and QA Pods come Sprint 1. Lower-priority items might remain at just user-story level descriptions to be fleshed out later. Having an initial spec library jump-starts development because the Dev Pod doesn’t have to start from a blank page – they already have well-defined targets to implement.  
- **Prototype/Demo (Optional):** In some cases, the team might create a simple prototype or proof-of-concept during Discovery to validate a concept. This isn’t a full feature, but maybe a thrown-together demo (for instance, a UI mock-up or a test of the AI model on a sample input). If such was done, it can be presented at the end of Discovery to stakeholders. However, prototypes are often disposable; the real code will be written properly in sprints. The main output here is confidence/learning, not a maintained artifact, though any code or config from a prototype could be saved in a `/experiments` folder for reference.  

All these artifacts should reside in the repository (mostly in the `docs/` directory) so they are accessible to all pods and persist through the projec ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=All%20these%20artifacts%20are%20stored,etc.%29%20for%20easy%20aggregation))】. For instance: the Discovery Report might be `/docs/wow/discovery_report.md`; the architecture diagram could be an image in `/docs/wow/architecture.png` with a write-up in `/docs/wow/architecture.md`; the backlog in `/docs/wow/backlog.yaml`; risk log in `/docs/wow/risks.md`; initial specs in `/docs/specs/`. During discovery, these can live in a “discovery” branch or a draft form, but by the end of the phase they should be merged into the main branch so that everyone (including AI pods) can reference them as we enter development.

## Transition from Discovery to Execution (Sprint 1 Handoff)  
As the Discovery Phase concludes, the team transitions into the regular development sprints. To ensure a smooth handoff:

- **Review & Sign-off:** The Delivery Lead Pod (with the human project owner and tech lead) should organize a Discovery Review meeting. In this meeting, the team presents the Discovery outputs – requirements, backlog, architecture, etc. – to stakeholders (could be internal leadership or the client) for feedback and approval. Any final clarifications or adjustments are made. This sign-off acts as a green light to start implementation. The WoW Pod may facilitate this meeting and ensure minutes are captured (especially noting any changes to artifacts).  
- **Initialize the Agile Process:** With backlog in hand, the Delivery Lead Pod conducts the first Sprint Planning. In this session, the team picks the top items from the backlog (usually starting with the highest priority features defined in discovery) and formulates the Sprint 1 plan. The initial spec library greatly aids this – those spec documents become the input for the Dev Pod. The Delivery Pod breaks down the features into tasks if needed and assigns to pods (Dev tasks for implementation, QA tasks for creating test cases, etc.), much like it would in any sprin ([AI-Native WoW Research.md](file://file-4H5UcHkwafVRmfEazrX4EJ#:~:text=,given%20a%20story%20%E2%80%9CAdd%20social))】. Essentially, we move from discovery mode to our regular multi-pod operation mode as defined in the SOPs above.  
- **Pods Role Adjustment:** Pods now switch to their execution behaviors:
  - The **Dev Pod** starts implementing features according to the specs produced. It should use the architecture and guidelines established (e.g., follow the solution approach decided – if the architecture said to use a certain API or library, stick to that). During Sprint 1, the Dev Pod might frequently refer to the Discovery artifacts like the architecture diagram or the end-to-end flow to ensure alignment with the envisioned design.
  - The **QA Pod** uses the acceptance criteria from the specs and the risk log to prepare its test plans. Any edge cases noted in Discovery or any compliance criteria should be turned into test scenarios. QA Pod might also set up necessary test data or environment configurations that were identified (e.g., if an external service key is needed, ensure it’s available).
  - The **Research Pod** continues to be active but now in a supporting role. Some discovery items may have follow-ups – for instance, if a risk was “need to choose an NLP model,” and the decision was left open, Research might carry that task into Sprint 1 to finalize. Also, new questions can arise during implementation, and Research will handle those on-the-fly. It’s common to have a continuous “Discovery track” in agile where research and design for future sprints overlaps with current developmen ([Discovery Phase of a Project: The Practical Guide — ITRex](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/discovery-phase-of-a-project-practical-guide/#:~:text=your%20project.%20,ahead%20of%20the%20development%20track))】. Our Research Pod will fulfill that role, staying one step ahead to inform upcoming work.
  - The **Delivery Lead Pod** transitions to the normal cadence of stand-ups, coordination, and tracking as defined in its SOP. It will use the backlog and risk log from Discovery as living documents – updating them as things get done or if new issues arise. It also uses the architecture doc as a reference to check that development is adhering to the planned design (if deviations are needed, they should be consciously decided, not accidental).  
  - The **WoW Pod** ensures that the process of Sprint 1 kicks off smoothly. It might do a quick refresher with the team on roles and SOPs now that actual development is starting. It will also note if any process adjustments are needed coming out of Discovery (for example, if Discovery revealed new stakeholders to loop in, WoW Pod updates communication plans). Additionally, WoW Pod might schedule the next retrospective at the end of Sprint 1 to capture any lessons from both Discovery and the first execution sprint.  

- **Utilization of Artifacts:** The artifacts produced should be actively used, not shelved. For example:
  - The **feature backlog** drives sprint planning and is updated as we complete items or re-prioritize based on any new info.
  - The **specs** are the direct inputs for Dev and QA – they will be revised if needed as development progresses (if any changes in understanding occur, Delivery/Dev/QA update the spec documents to keep them current).
  - The **architecture** acts as a guardrail: the Dev Pod and Delivery Lead refer to it when making lower-level design choices, and if something needs to change (maybe a different database after some testing), they update the architecture doc accordingly and discuss impact on other parts.
  - The **risk log** is monitored by the Delivery Lead each sprint. Risks that have been mitigated (e.g., a successful prototype may reduce a technical risk) are marked done, and new risks are added as they surface during development. Some teams review the risk log at each sprint planning to decide if any risk requires a specific mitigation task in that sprint.
  - The **end-to-end flow** serves as a basis for integration testing: once multiple features are built, QA Pod can walk through the flow to ensure all pieces work together as expected. It’s also a great reference for onboarding any new team members or reminding everyone of the big picture as they dive into details.
  
- **Carryover of Unfinished Discovery Tasks:** If any discovery activity was left incomplete (maybe pending an external input or a decision that stakeholders didn’t finalize), the Delivery Lead Pod should explicitly carry those as tasks into the execution phase (perhaps as backlog items or action items in Sprint 1). We don’t want to drop anything identified as important during discovery. For instance, if the solution architecture had two options and stakeholders wanted to see a quick POC of each in Sprint 1 before final decision, that becomes a Sprint 1 task assigned likely to the Dev or Research Pod.

- **Ensure Team Understanding:** Before coding starts, the Delivery Lead and WoW Pod should verify that each pod (and human team member) has understood the discovery outputs. This might mean a kickoff sync where the Delivery Pod walks the Dev Pod and QA Pod through the top features and architecture, clarifying any questions. The Research Pod might highlight key reference materials it compiled that Dev/QA should use. Essentially, treat it like passing the baton: Discovery collected the knowledge, now make sure the executors fully grasp it.

By following this transition plan, the **Discovery Phase** cleanly hands over a well-prepared project to the delivery phase. The team moves into Sprint 1 with a clear roadmap, known requirements, and confidence in the chosen approach, thanks to the groundwork laid in Discovery. This minimizes false starts and reduces the risk of major course changes later o ([Discovery Phase of a Project: The Practical Guide — ITRex](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/discovery-phase-of-a-project-practical-guide/#:~:text=fully,of%20the%20Agile%20project%20management)) ([Discovery Phase of a Project: The Practical Guide — ITRex](https://itrexgroup.com/blog/discovery-phase-of-a-project-practical-guide/#:~:text=Discovery%20deliverables%20help%20lower%20the,strategic%20decisions%20are%20considered%20and))】, allowing the development pods to focus on building the solution effectively from day one. The Discovery artifacts remain as living documents to be refined but they have essentially set the project up for success by giving everyone a shared understanding and direction.
