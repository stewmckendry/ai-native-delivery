# 🔍 Sprint Retrospective Notes

Each sprint, the delivery lead and pods may reflect on:
- What worked well
- What needs improvement
- Surprises, blockers, and experiments

## 📆 Sprint Reflections

### 🟢 Sprint 1 – Kickoff
- System initialized, first diff patch flowed through end-to-end
- Set up SOPs, GitOps, patch flow, trace logs

### ⏭ Sprint 2 – Add Here
- Add retro summary here after running `metrics_tracker.py`
- Can include pod-specific comments (e.g., "dev_pod delivered 3 features, missed 1 handoff")
