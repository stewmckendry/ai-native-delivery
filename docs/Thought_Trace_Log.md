## Example Entry

---
### Patch: gpt_patch_f4.3.diff
**Author:** dev_pod  
**Date:** 2025-04-22

**Reasoning:**
> User symptom data was often missing. We added a fallback response in `guidance_generator.py` to handle empty input and guide users to complete symptom checklist. This avoids hallucinated guidance from the LLM and aligns with QA-pod feedback.

**Linked Files:**  
- `src/models/guidance_generator.py`  
- `data/prompts/guidance_prompt.yaml`

**Changelog Ref:** Sprint 2 â€“ F4.3
