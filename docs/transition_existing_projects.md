# 📊 Transition Guide for Existing Projects – AI Delivery Cutover

Transitioning messy, human-heavy or code-heavy projects into structured, AI-native delivery requires a focused cutover. This guide describes how to lead that change.

---

## ⚠️ When to Use This
- Legacy projects
- AI initiatives with unclear ownership
- Codebases with no patch/log habits
- Manual handoffs and little reuse

---

## ⚡ Strategy: Send in the SWAT Team
A small pod transitions the project using 4 phases:

### 1. 🧹 Inventory
- Scan the current repo
- Identify:
  - Specs, data, prompts, scripts
  - Unstructured vs. structured files
  - AI usage patterns
- Summarize what’s working, missing, duplicated

### 2. 🧠 Map & Plan
- Decide what gets mapped to:
  - `docs/` (inputs, specs)
  - `scripts/` (logic)
  - `logs/` (history)
  - `.metrics/` (velocity)
- Create a `transition_plan.md`

### 3. ✂️ Cut & Convert
- Copy files into the new `ai_delivery_kit` structure
- Rewrite any SOPs as `docs/POD_SOPs.md`
- Use `generate_patch.py` to apply first batch of changes
- Use handoff logs to pass from transition pod to delivery pod

### 4. 🚀 Activate Pods
- Assign team members to each pod: `dev`, `qa`, `research`, `wow`
- Have each pod review their section in `docs/POD_SOPs.md`
- Ensure each pod understands their input/output expectations

### 5. 📄 Generate Missing Documentation
- If input/output docs are missing, generate them using AI tools
- Use templates in `docs/templates/` for:
  - `feature_spec_template.md`
  - `prompt_template.yaml`
  - `test_plan_template.md`
- Each pod should verify and refine AI-generated artifacts as needed

### 6. 🔁 Commit & Pivot
- Remove old directories after migration
- Begin full AI-native patch + log flow
- Update onboarding guide to point to new repo

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Backup
- Snapshot old repo before cutover
- Keep transition plan and diffs for traceability

---

## 🧪 Test Case: Concussion Agent
We'll pilot this strategy with the `Project7_AgentForms` repo.

Then extend the same to:
- Teams with 20+ year enterprise systems
- AI teams buried under Slack, docs, and duplicated prompts

This works. It’s fast. It’s bold. It’s reversible if needed.
