# 🔁 GitOps Setup Guide – AI-Native Delivery

This document captures what we did, why it matters, and when/where we use the one-shot setup script for Git-powered AI delivery.

---

## ✅ What Did We Just Do?
We ran a script called `setup_ai_delivery.sh` that:

1. **Created the full delivery folder structure**, including:
   - `.github/workflows/` – for automation via GitHub Actions
   - `.patches/` – where GPT pods will drop `.diff` patch files
   - `scripts/` – tools for applying patches and managing delivery

2. **Installed a GitHub Action** that:
   - Watches `.patches/` for any `.diff` files
   - Automatically creates a new feature branch (e.g. `chatgpt/auto/f4.3`)
   - Applies the patch
   - Commits + pushes the code
   - Opens a pull request for human review

3. **Added a working example patch file and a script to manually apply it.**

This establishes the foundation of our **AI-native GitOps model** where:
- ChatGPT can propose changes safely
- Humans always approve via PR
- All collaboration is structured, visible, and versioned

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters
> Every feature, prompt, YAML file, or output is a traceable object.

This GitOps foundation allows us to:
- Reduce copy-paste workflows between ChatGPT and your codebase
- Keep clean version history of all AI-generated contributions
- Automate integration and sprint flows at scale
- Introduce reproducibility and memory into pod conversations

Think of it as **your operating system for AI collaboration.**

## 📦 When Will We Use This?

### 🔁 Reuse This Setup:
- Anytime you start a **new AI-native delivery repo**
- As the core structure for projects like:
  - Concussion agent
  - RFP evaluator
  - Socratic baseball tutor
  - Enterprise AI experiments

### 🧪 During Development:
- Use `.patches/` to drop ChatGPT-generated diffs
- Let GitHub Actions auto-PR them to feature branches
- Use `scripts/apply_patch.sh` if working offline or testing locally

---

## ⏭️ What’s Next?
- 🧠 Add this setup script to a public `delivery-kit` repo
- 🚦 Extend GitHub Action to support changelogs and trace logs
- 🤖 Build pod tools to generate and drop diffs automatically
- ✍️ Draft pod contribution conventions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- 📊 Track metrics per pod (e.g. patch frequency, merge rate)

This is your future-proof system for human + AI software delivery.
Let’s keep refining it as we scale 🚀
