# ðŸ¤– AI Delivery Kit

Welcome to your reusable AI-native delivery toolkit â€” a modular system designed for multi-pod collaboration, automated patch workflows, structured logs, and velocity tracking.

## What's Inside

- `scripts/` â€“ patch generation, summaries, validation, and init tools
- `logs/` â€“ changelog, thought trace, handoff logs (YAML-based)
- `docs/` â€“ SOPs, delivery rituals, guides
- `.patches/` â€“ auto-generated patch files
- `.metrics/` â€“ velocity, burndown, and retrospective data

## Get Started

```bash
python scripts/wow_init.py
```

## Learn More

See `docs/POD_SOPs.md` and `docs/POD_CONTRIBUTING_Guide.md` for how pods work together.
